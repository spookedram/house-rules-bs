        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>Tabletop RPGs are insanely popular and are gaining players and followers now more than ever, but there is a high bar of entry that stops many casual players from picking and sticking with the more mainstream titles. Expensive books and sets filled with complicated rules and exceptions that take time and energy to learn have led to many parties choosing to implement their own <i>house rules</i> that change and simplify the game to keep the players engaged and interested and to keep the game's flow going.</p>
        <p><b>House Rules RPG</b> is an effort to lower that bar by providing:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>a clean and relatively short list of rules to follow,</li>
          <li>a character sheet creation tool, and</li>
          <li>a story structure tool for writing quests.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By making the tabletop RPG experience easier, we hope to help encourage casual players to engage in fun and interesting play with their friends and family. <b>House Rules RPG</b> has the added benefit of putting creative power back into the Player's hands; you build your characters based on the setting and world that your party creates together. You can use these tools for typical high-fantasy adventures, but you can also use them for sci-fi, horror, post-apocalyptic, and more. The genre of your game is in your hands and can change whenever you want it to! Tabletop RPGs not only provide exciting entertainment, they also foster stronger relationships and teach critical thinking, problem solving skills, and leadership.</p>
