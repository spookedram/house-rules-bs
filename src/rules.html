            <p>Before you can start playing <b>House Rules RPG</b>, you'll need:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a Game Master</li>
              <li>a Quest</li>
              <li>1 or more Players (with a character sheet)</li>
              <li>a dice set (or simulator)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Using the Dice Simulator</h4>
            <p><b>House Rules RPG</b> provides a dice simulator on the character creation and quest creation pages, in the upper-right hand corner of the header. Simply click the button to open the dice simulator panel and click the "Roll" button to generate a random number between 1 and 20. You can also check the radio button next to "Other" and use the inputs to set the amount and type of dice you want to roll.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="actions">Taking Actions</h3>

            <h4>Free Actions</h4>
            <p>During the game, Players will want their character to interact with the world and will do so by <b>taking an action</b>. Actions that aren't difficult, like speaking bluntly or opening an unlocked door, are <b>free actions</b>. If an action takes any skill, knowledge, or luck then the Player will need to roll a <b>difficulty check</b>.</p>

            <h4>Difficulty Checks</h4>
            <p>Throwing a knife to cut a swinging rope, disarming a ticking time bomb, and summoning an unknowable beast from another dimension are a lot more difficult than opening an unlocked door. Actions with any level of difficulty require a <b>difficulty check (DC)</b>. The Player will describe the action they want to attempt and the Game Master decides what modifier is being checked and how difficult the action being taken is as a number (which they may or may not share with the player). Then the Player rolls a <b>d20</b> to see if they succeed or fail the action. For example:</p>

            <blockquote>
              Player: "I want to use my new lockpick on the cage."<br>
              GM: "Alright, roll a <b>dexterity check</b>."<br>
              GM (thinking): <i>Probably a DC of 14...</i><br>
              Player: "Nice! I rolled a 16!"<br>
              GM: "You pick the lock... and inside you find a sleeping circus bear."
            </blockquote>

            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> It can take some practice to put a number to an action's difficulty, but remember, Game Masters, that your party can sometimes combine rolls to give the more difficult actions the advantage of teamwork. For instance, lifting a truck could take a strength roll of 40, requiring all party members to help out.</p>

            <p>You might have noticed that the Player's action had an ability that was being checked. When an action is likely going to result from a test of a character's abilities, the difficulty check is modified by the character's score for the ability being checked.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="abScores">Ability Scores</h3>
            <p>Every character and creature in <b>House Rules RPG</b> has 7 ability scores, represented by a number between 1 and 20. The abilities cover a wide variety of character attributes and actions that can be taken. These 7 abilities are:</p>
            <table class="table">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <th>Strength</th>
                  <td>Represents muscle and physical power</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Dexterity</th>
                  <td>Represents agility, reflexes, and balance</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Constitution</th>
                  <td>Represents health, stamina, and endurance</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Intelligence</th>
                  <td>Represents critical thinking, learning, and logic</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Wisdom</th>
                  <td>Represents willpower, common sense, and intuition</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Charisma</th>
                  <td>Represents personality, likability, and ability to lead</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Perception</th>
                  <td>Represents senses and awareness</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

            <p class="well"><b>Perception</b> is used when a character will need to "notice" something odd, significant, or dangerous around them. This can come from a trap ready to spring, a hidden enemy, or a clue hidden in a room.</p>

            <p>Characters start with 10 points on each score, because 10 points means 0 modifier. Each number greater or less than 10 adds a modifier to ability checks. For example:</p>

            <blockquote>
              Player: "Can Killgrog understand the hieroglyphs?"<br>
              GM: "Go ahead and make an intelligence check."<br>
              Player: "Uh oh, he's isn't exactly a genius..."<br>
              GM: "You can try and roll anyway."<br>
              Player: "I rolled a 10, but his INT score is 7, so minus 3..."<br>
              GM: "Yeah, that failed."<br>
              Killgrog: "It's a butterscotch recipe!"
            </blockquote>

            <p>When you make your character, consider taking points from areas where they are weak and placing those points on abilities where they are strong. That way, when your character makes difficulty checks, they're more likely to succeed at actions they're good at and more likely to fail at actions they're bad at. We recommend going <b>no lower than 7</b> and <b>no higher than 18</b> on any one ability, at least to start. You never know when a brawler will need to make an intelligence roll to save his team. Of course, the odd critical roll will always happen.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="critRolls">Critical Rolls</h3>
            <p>If you roll for a difficulty check or an attack and it lands on 1, the result is a <b>critical miss</b>. The action or attack you were trying to make fails instantly and often dramatically, and can even end up causing damage to your character depending on the situation. On the other hand, if you roll a <i>natural 20</i>, that is, a 20 without modifiers, it's known as a <b>critical hit</b> and it means that the action or attack is an instant success, sometimes even resulting in a one-hit-kill. The intensity of the action is between you and the Game Master to decide; the Player narrates their character making the action and the Game Master narrates the result or effect.</p>

            <h4>Advantage and Disadvantage</h4>
            <p>Some perks, teamwork, and other situations will grant the person rolling a dice something called <i>advantage</i> or <i>disadvantage</i>. When a Player has advantage on a roll, they roll twice and keep the higher roll as their result. In the case of disadvantage, the Player keeps the lower roll. Advantage and disadvantage can come from a character's perks, environmental effects, curses, or just plain dumb luck (courtesy of the Game Master).</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Encounters</h3>
            <p>Encounters are the moments when the characters <i>encounter</i> obstacles on their quest. These are the high-tension scenes in the quest, and can take many forms. Some examples of encounters are puzzles, hunts, races, sports, and of course, combat. It's important to note that, in storytelling, violence happens when someone has no other method by which to overcome an obstacle. Game Masters, don't force your Players into combat! Just present moments of conflict and if they would like to resolve it peacefully, give them a chance to make some charisma difficulty checks, or even just talk it out.</p>
            <p><i>Not every encounter has to be a bloodbath.</i></p>


            <h3 id="combat">Combat</h3>
            <p>If it does come to battle, by the Player's hands or the NPCs, everyone must know the rules of combat. Combat is the easiest, most visceral way to add tension and excitement to the narrative.</p>

            <h4>Initiative</h4>
            <p>To begin combat, the Players will roll <b>dexterity checks</b> for their character(s) and the Game Master will do the same for each type of enemy involved in the encounter. The highest roll goes first, followed by second highest, etc. When the order is set, the character(s) or creature(s) with the highest roll get to take their turn by attacking or taking an action.</p>
            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> If a character or creature has the element of surprise, either rolling a successful dexterity check or their target fails a perception check, they can attack <i>before</i> the initiative roll.</p>

            <h4>Turns</h4>
            <p>A <b>turn</b> is a character or creature's <i>turn</i> to fight. They get to make <b>1 movement</b> and <b>1 action</b> (in that order) before the next person in the initiative order gets their turn. A movement is changing position, drawing a weapon, reloading a bow/gun, or using a movement-based perk. <b>You can only use 1 perk per turn.</b> A character or creature can also decide to either make a movement and skip their action or skip their movement and only take an action, if they want.</p>

            <h4>Rounds</h4>
            <p>One round of combat represents roughly <b>6 seconds</b> in the game world. One round is everyone in the order getting their turn, taking actions and attacking, defending and making saving throws. Once it's back to the first in the order it's a new round. Combat moves quickly but, if it's going too long, the Players and Game Master can always look for other options, like running away.</p>

            <h3>Attacking</h3>
            <p>Attacks can be made with unarmed strikes, weapons, spells, curses, summoned creatures, thrown objects... whatever the character or creature pleases.  First the attacker will <b>make an attack roll using a d20</b>, applying their appropriate ability score modifier. There are different conditions depending on the nature of the attack.</p>

            <h4>Physical Strikes</h4>
            <p>If the attack is a close to medium range physical strike with a sword, club, staff, pole, dagger, wrench, etc. then the attacker compares their attack roll against the target's <b>armor class (AC)</b>. If the result is higher than their target's AC, then the attack hits and the attacker rolls their weapon's <b>damage dice</b> to see how much damage the target will take. If the result is lower than their AC, the attack fails and play continues to the next character or creature in the order.</p>

            <h4>Saving Throws</h4>
            <p>Successful physical strikes cannot be defended against (unless the target has a perk that allows them to parry or dodge), but ranged attacks like arrows, spells, or bullets require the target to roll a <b>d20</b> for a saving throw, basically a dodge, and add the appropriate ability score modifier. If the resulting saving throw is higher than the attack roll, the target successfully <b>evades the attack</b>. If not, the attacker deals damage.</p>
            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> Saving throws can also be used to avoid environmental dangers and traps, set in place by the Game Master.</p>

            <h3>Combat Table</h3>
            <p class="n-mb">The following are examples of different ability score modifiers an attacker would apply and saving throws a target would roll, depending on the kind of attack being made:</p>

            <h4>Dealing Damage</h4>
            <p>Each type of weapon has a <b>type</b> which also dictates what type of die is rolled for applying damage. Any item can be used as a physical weapon, so base the weapon's type on the physical size of the object (unless it's a ranged weapon or a shield, of course). Every 3 levels a character gets to add a die to their weapon's damage. See the table below:</p>

            <h3 id="health">Health</h3>
            <p>All characters and creatures have another number that represents their health, called <b>hit points</b>. Your character's max hit points is the amount of damage they can sustain before going unconcious and eventually dying. Characters lose hit points from successful enemy attacks, but can also revive hit points for themselves and/or others with perks, first aid kits, health potions, or good old rest (outside of combat, of course).</p>

            <p>When a character's HP is reduced to zero the character falls <b>unconcious</b>. The Player has 3 <i>death saving throws</i> (using a <b>d20 with no modifier</b>) as a way for their character to cling to life and give their party members a chance to heal them and bring them back from the brink. Healing may or may not wake them, but the character will no longer be dying. If the Player manages to roll 3 saves (3 rolls higher than 10) and the character hasn't been healed, they wake with <b>1d6 HP</b>. If they fail all 3 saving throws before their party can stabilize them, they die.</p>

            <p>Some Game Masters may allow for an afterlife of some kind as a way to keep the Player in the game or allow the Player to create a new character to bring in on the next quest, but it's recommended that ghost characters not be given corporeal power or a means to speak with the party unless a party member has a perk that allows them to do so. If death isn't a punishment then there's no risk to combat!</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> Game Masters, make character death satisfying or temporary if you want to maintain an amicable relationship with your Players.</p>

            <p>There are several example characters on the Character Save/Load panel that you can use as a starting point. Simply click the Save/Load button, select the example character you want to view from the dropdown list, and click the load button! Then you can tweak the character's stats to fit your needs.</p>

            <h3 id="nameTitle">Name and Title</h3>
            <p>You character needs a name and a title. Below is a list of possible titles:</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> Make sure you try and at least loosely match your character with the world your Game Master has created!</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="hitPoints">Hit Points</h3>
            <p>Your character's <b>hit points (HP)</b> represent the amount of damage they can take before they fall unconcious and must roll their death saving throws. At level 1, your character's HP will be the same as their constitution score. Every time a character levels up the Player will roll a d10, add the character's constitution modifier, and add the result to their max HP.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="equip">Equipment</h3>
            <p>Every character will have equipment they carry with them, mainly their weapons, armor, and other assorted gear.</p>

            <h4>Main Weapon</h4>
            <p>You character's <b>main weapon</b> is their main mode of action during encounters. It can be a baseball bat, a broadsword, a healing staff, a blessed silver acoustic guitar with the name "Heather" written across it in hot-pink glitter... whatever you want. Every weapon will have a <b>name</b>, a <b>description</b> of the weapon's appearance and extra attributes, and a <b>type</b>, which determines the type and amount of dice you will roll after landing a successful attack with it.</p>

            <h4>Sub Weapon</h4>
            <p>Some characters will carry a shield, others will carry a bow or some other ranged weapon, and others still will just carry another head-basher to rush in dual-wield style. The secondary weapon, or <b>sub weapon</b> helps add an extra element to your character, and also has a name, description, and type.</p>

            <h4>Animal Companions</h4>
            <p>Players have three choices when it comes to giving their character an animal companion. The animal can be <i>purely narrative</i> and <b>idle during combat</b>, the Player can create a <b>separate character sheet</b> for the animal and treat it as a separate, secondary character, or they can include the animal companion as their character's <b>sub weapon</b>, writing in their name, description of an attack they can make, and what "type" the animal would be. Cats are small, birds are ranged, dogs are medium, bears are large, and as strange as it sounds, if your animal fits the use of a shield, like a massive turtle, it could also have that type.</p>

            <p class="well">We recommend the sub weapon option because it strikes a good balance, but the other options are available if you want a different experience.</p>

            <h4>Armor</h4>
            <p>The <b>armor</b> section of the character sheet describes your character's clothing and garbs. If your character decides to wear some kind of protective gear, be it steel armor or elbow pads, you'll give it a <b>name</b> and <b>description</b> here, along with giving it a <b>type</b>. Keep in mind that there are penalties to heavier armors, but the protection they provide can definitely improve your character's chances of defending against attacks. Below are the armor types and their benefits/penalties:</p>
            <table class="table">
              <thead>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>AC</th>
                <th>Desc</th>

                  <td>If your character is wearing regular clothing, a hazmat suit, or nothing at all, they have an armor type of <i>none</i>.</td>
                  <td>+2 to initiative rolls</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                  <td>If your character is wearing leather armor, plastic pads, or magic cloth, they have an armor type of <i>light</i>.</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Medium (AC 14)</td>
                  <td>If your character is wearing bulletproof gear or partial steel/iron armor, they have an armor type of <i>medium</i>.</td>
                  <td>+4 to AC, -2 to initiative rolls</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Heavy (AC 16)</td>
                  <td>If your character is wearing dragon bones, a riot suit, or full steel/iron armor, they have an armor type of <i>heavy</i>.</td>
                  <td>+6 to AC, -4 to initiative rolls</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

            <h4>Gear</h4>
            <p>Your character's <b>gear</b> is the extra equipment or magical items they carry. It could be survival gear, research tools, thieving tools, camping gear, etc. The gear section is also where you'll add mementos and important nostalgic items from your character's past, provided they carry it on them at all times. Try to reflect your character's daily needs in the gear they carry and don't forget that you can make use of their gear during the quests. Keep track of what your characters are holding, they can come in handy.</p>

            <h4>Extra Attributes</h4>
            <p>Extra attributes are essentially the special conditions or powers that a weapon, a set of armor, or an item possesses. Maybe it glows when a special type of enemy is nearby, or it has advantage in certain weather. It could be that it protects against or enchances a certain kind of attack. An example would be a wand that shoots lightning; you'd describe the wand first and add something like "Allows wielder to fire a lightning bolt at a target for 1d8 electric damage." The wand would still be a Small (d4) weapon, but when used correctly it will do the same damage as a Medium (d8) weapon.</p>

            <p>Extra attributes are useful for leveraging a character's INT and WIS scores, specifically for <b>magic users</b>, but can also help rouge-type characters who have poison darts, for instance. Extra Attributes <b>must be approved by the Game Master</b> and/or the rest of the party before you play. It's not fair for you character to pull out a pocketwatch they inherited from their grandfather during a fight and claim that his ghost can be summoned to fight alongside you, <i>unless your Game Master knew about it and allowed it ahead of time</i>.</p>

            <h3 id="perks">Perks</h3>
            <p>Rather than fuss around with complicated skill trees, spells, feats, domains, and combat maneuvers, <b>House Rules RPG</b> keeps it simple by giving each character 8 <b>perks</b>. Perks can be spells, combat techniques, tactics, powers, abilities, attacks, or other special actions that your character can take. They can be actions linked to a profession, attacks that do damage, actions that change a target's modifiers for a certain number of rounds, or effects that occur when if the target fails a saving throw. When designing your character's perks, think about actions that are unique to their body or mind. A reptilian character might have a venomous bite as a perk, where as a healing-based character might have an assortment of restorative techniques. Each character will be different and will have a different power curve to consider.</p>

            <blockquote>
              Player: "I'm going to use my perk 'Light's Out' on the cybergoblin."<br>
              Player rolls a 15.<br>
              GM: "Alright the cybergoblin is going to roll a DEX saving throw."<br>
              GM rolls a 16.<br>
              Player: "Aw dang."<br>
              GM: "Cybergoblins have a -2 to dexterity, so it hits."<br>
              Player: "Oh! Okay awesome, he's blinded!"
            </blockquote>

            <p>Characters start with 2 perks and unlock a new one every 3 levels. You get a certain number of uses per day that increases with your level, described below.</p>

            <h3 id="lvlUp">Leveling Up</h3>
            <p>Characters and creatures in <b>House Rules RPG</b> have a level, a score between 1 and 20 that shows their progress and their power within the world. Every time your character gains a level, usually at the end of a significant quest, they have some opportunities to strengthen their character. Every time a character levels up, their Player gets to roll a d10, add their character's constitution modifier, and add the result to <b>increase their max hit points</b> (if their constitution modifier brings the result into the negatives, add only 1 to their max hit points). Depending on the level your character is gaining, you might also unlock a new perk, gain a new point to add to an ability of your choice, or gain a die to add to your weapon damage. Your character also receives some <b>gold</b> that can be used to purchase equipment and items.</p>

            <h4>Buying Items</h4>
            <p>Whether or not your party will get gold to spend on magic items after leveling up is something you should discuss before the game starts. It can take some extra time to come up with magic items to sell, but there's lots of places to go for inspiration. Consider what kinds of items could be useful in-game: things that enable communication, protection, traversal, disguise, or power over the elements are a few ideas. You can have one-use items that give advantage to certain rolls or add a point to a modifier when used, or you could just have various interesting garbs and armors just for appearance. It's up to you and your party, be creative and have fun with it!</p>

            <h3>Sample Quests</h3>
            <p>There are several example quests on the Quest Save/Load panel that you can use as a starting point. Simply click the Save/Load button, select the example quest you want to view from the dropdown list, and click the load button! Then you can tweak the quest to fit your needs or simply use it to gain a better understanding of what to write in each box.</p>

            <h3 id="theme">Writing Quests</h3>
            <p>The Game Master is, for all intents and purposes, the lead storyteller. They set up the world, the non-player characters, and the events that the Players will trigger by traversing through, and interacting with, the setting. To be an effective Game Master you must know how to set up compelling scenes, puzzles, and encounters for your party and become an actor, breathing life into every NPC (hostile or otherwise) that the Players come across. It's a tough job, but it can be incredibly rewarding.</p>

            <h4>Theme</h4>
            <p>The key to writing a story with depth is to start with a solid theme. A theme is the core idea of the story, what the whole quest will revolve around. In story writing, the theme is the author's argument; it's a core issue that is being viewed through many lenses and perspectives. But at the end, theme also takes a side in the argument, it is the moral of the story. Think of a specific emotion or issue you want to explore, but try to keep it simple and strong. Some examples of themes include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There are no rules in love</li>
              <li>Immortality carries a cost</li>
              <li>In extreme circumstances, stealing is ethical</li>
              <li>Nature is careless and dangerous</li>
              <li>Peace means nothing without justice</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are all arguments, but you could just as easily write quests around the opposites of those ideas. Pick an issue, take a side. Once you have a theme in mind you can start to think about ways to explore the different aspects of it: twist it around and find new perspectives on it and build some scenarios from the results. If you're having trouble coming up with one or you're not sure if what you have is a theme, ask these three questions:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>What is this quest about?</li>
              <li>Why do I want to run this quest?</li>
              <li>Will my Players care about this quest?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> The theme is best used with subtlety; it's not something you're going to announce or talk about with your Players until after the quest is completed. Also understand that the issue you're taking a side on might conflict with one of your Player's beliefs, but this is also an opportunity to engage in discussion and learn about each other.</p>
            <p>If you'd rather stay away from debating or you just want something easy, you can pick something from this list instead:</p>

            <h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
            <p>A change of scenery can easily ramp up the tension or provide a lull between action, something you'll want to take advantage of, but try not to have too many conflicting environments or lots of extraneous travel in one story or you risk confusing or boring your Players. Do you drop your players into a swamp? Are they sneaking through an ancient temple trying to avoid dangerous cultists? Or maybe they're making their way through a decimated version of Manhattan? The number of settings and amount of detail will change depending on your quest, but take some time to consider each one and try to sum it up in a short, clear, descriptive way for your settings list.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="npcs">Non-Player Characters</h3>
            <p>Every good quest has <b>non-player characters (NPCs)</b>, controlled by the Game Master, for the Players to interact with. These are not just the townsfolk and allies, but also the enemies and secret-keepers of the game. A good Game Master will try to breathe life into the NPCs of the quest, giving them unique personalities and voices. They'll hopefully become characters that the Players will get invested in, that they'll love (or love to hate). NPCs will require character sheets as well, although you maybe don't want spend too much time on the details of cannon-fodder enemies.</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> If you're creating an NPC higher than level 1 using the character creator, first set their constitution, then their level, then click the "Update HP" button to simulate adding Hit Points for each level the character has gained. Try to stick with the first or second roll, to simulate the randomness involved in rolling dice for each level.</p>

            <h4>Creating Enemies</h4>
            <p>Simple enemies don't need a full character sheet, though you can still use the Character Creator to build them. You can shortcut the process: when creating and writing a simple enemy into the quest, only include their name, level, modifiers (only ones that would affect rolls), HP, AC, weapon damage, and no more than 3 perks.</p>
            <b>Examples:</b>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h4>Level 4 Hobgoblin</h4>
                <p>STR +1 / DEX +1 / CHA -2<br>
                  HP 23 / AC 12 / DMG 2d8<br>
                  <b>Perks</b><br>
                  <i>Lick Wounds:</i> 3d8 HP healing<br>
                  <i>Cutpurse:</i> DC 14 DEX to steal 100g from target.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h4>Level 14 Nightstalker</h4>
                <p>STR +3 / DEX +1 / CON +3 / INT -2<br>
                  HP 117 / AC 10 / DMG 5d4<br>
                  <b>Perks</b><br>
                  <i>Rend Flesh:</i> 10d8 DMG<br>
                  <i>Vanish:</i> 6 round/DC 17 PER<br>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> When designing perks for enemies, use perks closer to their level. You can decide to include a description if the name doesn't describe the effects well enough.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="rAndP">Rhythm and Pacing</h3>
            <p>An engaging story has everything to do with <b>pacing</b>. Knowing when and how to raise the stakes and release the tension to let your Players breathe is crucial to creating a satisfying experience. Too much tension for too long and your Players will go numb waiting for a break. Not enough and your story is boring. Oscillating between moments of action and moments of rest gives your Players time to process and regroup, to get perspective and put the stakes into proper context. The quest writing tool can help you pace out events in your quest to maintain a good rhythm of <b>highs and lows.</b></p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <p>Sometimes a quest needs a little narration up front to set the scene, introduce some NPCs, and ease the Players into the world and put the quest into perspective. Not every quest will require this level of easing though, some will start off with a bang! If that's the case, skip the setup and jump straight into setting the goal.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="act1">Act One</h3>
            <h4>High - Goal Set</h4>
            <p>Every quest has an <b>end goal</b>. Whether or not the climax and resolution have anything to do with the original goal is irrelevant, what matters is that the party starts their quest with a <b>specific purpose</b>. This is a one-sentence call to action that sums up the reason the party is taking action. Are they after a large amount of treasure? Have they been contracted to stop a group of kidnappers? Maybe they must prove their innocence after being falsely (or rightly) accused of murder. Whatever it is, your Players must be given a <i>clear goal</i> to strive towards. Keep the theme in mind when writing the goal.</p>

            <h4>Low - Wandering</h4>
            <p>For the first real stretch of the story, the Players should be in charge. They'll be the ones deciding where to go and who to talk to, and the Game Master will be reacting by giving out small hints and subtly guiding them towards the first encounter, the first peak in tension, that will hopefully remind them of the cost of failure.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="act2">Act Two</h3>
            <h4>High - Fun Fight</h4>
            <p>The first true encounter of the story should be a chance for Players to stretch their role playing muscles. It must be higher tension than a simple investigation or traversal, but it should also be less of a challenge than what's to come. Your Players want to feel powerful, they want to use the new skills and weapons at their disposal, and this first encounter should satisfy that desire.</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Combat:</b> Stick to enemies lower than your party's level. Consider multiples and make it fun by adding in an interesting element; maybe they're fighting in sinking sand or they have to finish in a certain number of rounds before the police arrive.</p>

            <h4>Low - The Twist</h4>
            <p>Something about the quest is wrong. Somebody is lying, something else is brewing, and the initial threat is much more powerful or complicated than what was first thought. The twist is the moment where the Players realize that <b>the goal isn't quite what they thought it was</b>. Lead them into the twist or reveal it in a moment of instant revelation, but don't give away the whole secret just yet.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="act3">Act Three</h3>
            <h4>High - The Challenge</h4>
            <p>This encounter should be a real test of the Player’s combat and problem solving skills. It's a heightened reminder of the cost of failure but it's also a reminder that the characters have still come far. Make it difficult, make it hurt, but make sure that the characters will come out the other end stronger, or at least more cautious, than they were when they started.</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Combat:</b> Try some enemies on an equal level to your Player's characters. You can make it interesting with a chase sequence or some environmental obstacles.</p>

            <h4>Low - The Search Ends</h4>
            <p>This is the turning point, the beginning of the end. The characters have been stumbling around after the test and are collecting the last few clues they need to unravel the mystery. This event is <b>the big reveal</b>. Lead them right to the edge and drop the truth bomb, lure them in and then force them right into the last stretch running.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="act4">Act Four</h3>
            <h4>High - The Climax</h4>
            <p>The final battle, the last encounter of the quest. This will be <i>the most difficult challenge for the Players yet</i>, it will test their skills and push them to the limit. The risk is the highest it's been, but the payoff is huge. This is the time to pull out all the stops.<p>

            <p class="well"><b>Combat:</b> It's the final battle; at least 1 enemy should be a few levels higher than your Player's characters. Add some minions or dangerous (but not all-powerful) perks.</p>

            <h4>Low - Epilogue</h4>
            <p>With the threat subdued and the quest at its end, this last little lull is for the characters to collect their spoils, say their goodbyes, level up, and rest before the next quest begins. Give them time to <b>wrap up the story</b> and put a bow on it, time to feel the satisfaction of the win or to let the grief and loss from the quest settle in, or both.<p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Cliffhanger (Optional)</h3>
            <p>With the quest at its end you may wish to give your Players a <i>taste of what's brewing on the horizon</i>, which you can include in the form of a <b>cliffhanger</b>. Give them just enough of a morsel to get them excited for the next session.<p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="transition">Transition</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you may want to take a session to regroup and give your Players a rest themselves. It helps to think of sessions as high points, once in awhile you need to let them breathe and adjust their course. Give them low-risk interactions and provide moments where they can dig deeper into their characters thoughts and feelings, moments to build their characters into more complete forms.</p>

            <p>For example, you can give your characters time to visit past victories, take a trip home to see their family, or to reflect on their losses. Let it be a reminder of why they’re going on these quests. This can also be a good place to <b>switch out party members</b>; you can give their character a peaceful, satisfying ending rather than just letting them vanish out of thin air.</p>

            <h3 id="pregame">Before the Game</h3>
            <h4>Setting Up a Party</h4>
            <p>First you have to find people to play with. You can do a solo quest with a Player and a Game Master, or a bigger party with many Players. The first session you have should be a round-table discussion about the kind of game you want to play and laying down your own personal rules about how to handle touchy subjects like character death, re-rolls, and rule challenges. Write them down and bring them to the session! Pick at least a vague genre, or agree to a completely random open-world, so that you can create quests and characters that don't conflict too badly. This first session is not for jumping in and playing your first quest, although there are sample characters and quests you can use if you'd rather jump right in instead of crafting a personalized experience.</p>

            <h4>Creating Characters</h4>
            <p>You can also use the first session to help each other with creating your characters (the Game Master can get started on the first quest). We recommend using the <a href="character.html">Character Creator</a> page of our site, but if you'd rather use pen and paper that's fine too. Just make sure you follow the required fields on the <a href="character.html">Character Creator</a> page.</p>
            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> Our <a href="character.html">Character Creator</a> and <a href="quest.html">Quest Writer</a> tools save data to your browser locally. You may not see the same list of content from different browsers, ie. your laptop vs your mobile device, and if the storage is cleared there is no way to retrieve your characters or quests.</p>
            <p>You can save your characters more securely by printing them to PDF using the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-print"></span> button and choosing "Save as PDF" as the destination. On mobile, some browsers allow you to Save to PDF or Add to Reading List. Once you have the PDF of your character, you can print out paper copies or just reference them from your device.</p>
            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> Your Game Master should have copies of every Player character sheet to run the quest!</p>
            <p>Finally, set a time and place for the sessions. It can be face-to-face, over audio/video chat, however you want. You can play with friends out of state or right in your living room, but work it out ahead of time and <b>show up on time</b> for the session!</p>

            <h4>Etiquette</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Eat before the game, on your own or as a group, to avoid distracting snacking during play.</li>
              <li>Take a few minutes before the session starts to get non-game chitchat out of your system.</li>
              <li>Don't be late without letting your Game Master (or other host) know about it</li>
              <li>Have some water or another beverage handy.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="during">During the Game</h3>
            <h4>Running a Quest</h4>
            <p>Game Masters, remember that you may have crafted the settings and events of the quest but your Player's characters are the ones who are living inside it. Do not make big decisions for them and try not to force them into situations. It's better to drop subtle clues and let the Players guide themselves through the quest, offering a nudge in the right direction only occasionally.</p>

            <h4>Rule Challenges</h4>
            <p>Sometimes people make mistakes. Sometimes a perk turns out to be game-breakingly powerful. Sometimes your Game Master will go mad, flip the table, and send your characters straight into a volcano. It's important to know ahead of time what's acceptable and what's not, or at least how to deal with it. Seek to compromise where you can; if your character is blasting through every enemy like tissue paper, maybe you and your Game Master can set up a situation to narratively hinder them, weaken them, bring them back to equal footing with the rest of the party. If your Players have all had to roll death saving throws for 15 minutes, maybe you overestimated their combat skills and need to intervene for the sake of the story (and your relationships with your Players).</p> <p><b>House Rules RPG</b> is by no means a perfect system, especially since it puts most of the actual responsibility in your hands, but it's also supposed to be fun! It's a game, try not to hurt each other and work around the broken parts of the game as they come up.</p>

            <h4>Etiquette</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Don't hog the spotlight.</li>
              <li>Don't talk over each other.</li>
              <li>Don't take actions for another Player's character (unless your party allows perks that cause possession or mind-control, but if that's the case it shouldn't be offensive).</li>
              <li>Respect the rules you agreed on regarding character death, re-rolls, and rule challenges.</li>
              <li>The Game Master may control the game, but they do not control the Players. If a Game Master has acted unfairly, pause the game and talk it out before resuming.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="postgame">After the Game</h3>

            <h4>Etiquette</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Don't overstay your welcome or push to keep the session going later than appropriate.</li>
              <li>If you're playing in person and there's a mess from food, maps, dice, and/or figurines, help clean up a bit.</li>
              <li>Have an agreement and understanding about the time and place for the next session.</li>
              <li>Thank your Game Master and your Host!</li>
