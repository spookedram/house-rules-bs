            <p>Before you can start playing <b>House Rules RPG</b>, you'll need:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a Game Master</li>
              <li>a Quest</li>
              <li>1 or more Players</li>
              <li>with at least 1 character each</li>
              <li>An understanding of the rules</li>
              <li>a dice set or an RNG</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="actions">Taking Actions</h3>

            <h4>Free Actions</h4>
            <p>During the game, Players will want their character to interact with the world and will do so by <b>taking an action</b>. Actions of little difficulty, such as speaking bluntly or opening an unlocked door, are <b>free actions</b>. If an action is more difficult then the Player will need to roll a <b>difficulty check</b>.</p>

            <h4>Difficulty Checks</h4>
            <p>Throwing a knife to cut a swinging rope, disarming a ticking time bomb, and summoning an unknowable beast from another dimension are actions much more difficult than opening an unlocked door. Actions with any level of difficulty require a difficulty check. The Player will describe the action they want to attempt and the Game Master decides what modifier is being checked and how difficult the action being taken is (as a number which they may or may not share with the player). Then the Player rolls a <b>d20</b> to see if they succeed or fail the action. For example:</p>

            <blockquote>
              Player: "I want to use my new lockpick on the cage."<br>
              GM: "Alright, roll a <b>dexterity check</b>."<br>
              GM (thinking): <i>Probably a DC of 14...</i><br>
              Player: "Nice! I rolled a 16!"<br>
              GM: "You pick the lock. Sadly, you've also woken the circus bear inside..."
            </blockquote>

            <p>You might have noticed that the Player's action had an ability that was being checked. When an action is likely going to result from a test of a character's abilities, the difficulty check is modified by the character's score for the ability being checked.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="abScores">Ability Scores</h3>
            <p>Every character and creature in <b>House Rules RPG</b> has 6 ability scores, represented by a number between 1 and 20. The abilities cover a wide variety of character attributes and actions that can be taken. These 6 abilities are:</p>
            <table class="table">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <th>Strength</th>
                  <td>Represents muscle and physical power</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Dexterity</th>
                  <td>Represents agility, reflexes, and balance</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Constitution</th>
                  <td>Represents health, stamina, and endurance</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Intelligence</th>
                  <td>Represents critical thinking, learning, and logic</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Wisdom</th>
                  <td>Represents willpower, common sense, and intuition</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Charisma</th>
                  <td>Represents personality, likability, and ability to lead</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Characters start with 10 points on each score, because 10 points means 0 modifier. Each number greater or less than 10 adds a modifier to ability checks. For example:</p>

            <blockquote>
              Player: "Does Killgrog understand the hieroglyphs?"<br>
              GM: "Go ahead and make an intelligence check."<br>
              Player: "Uh oh, he's isn't exactly a genius..."<br>
              GM: "You can try and roll anyway."<br>
              Player: "I rolled a 10, but his INT score is 7, so minus 3..."<br>
              GM: "Yeah, that failed."<br>
              Killgrog: "It's a butterscotch recipe!"
            </blockquote>

            <p>When you make your character, consider taking points from areas where they are weak and placing theose points on abilities where they are strong. That way, when your character makes difficulty checks, they're more likely to succeed at actions they're good at and more likely to fail at actions they're bad at like in real life. Of course, the odd critical roll can always happen.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="critRolls">Critical Rolls</h3>
            <p>If you roll for a difficulty check or an attack and it lands on 1, the result is a <b>critical miss</b>. The action or attack you were trying to make fails instantly and often dramatically, and can even end up causing damage to your character depending on the situation. On the other hand, if you roll a <i>natural 20</i>, that is, a 20 without modifiers, it's known as a <b>critical hit</b> and it means that the action or attack is an instant success, sometimes even resulting in a one-hit-kill. The intensity of the action or attack is between you and the Game Master to decide, the Player narrating the action and the Game Master narrating the result of the action.</p>

            <h4>Advantage and Disadvantage</h4>
            <p>Some special moves, teamwork, and situations will grant the person rolling a dice something called <i>advantage</i> or <i>disadvantage</i>. When a Player has advantage on a roll, they roll twice and keep the higher roll as their result. In the case of disadvantage, the Player keeps the lower roll. Advantage and disadvantage can come from a character's special moves, environmental effects, curses, or just plain dumb luck courtesy of the Game Master.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="combat">Combat</h3>
            <p>Eventually the heroes of the story will be met with obstacles that can only be moved by force. It's the easiest, most visceral way to add tension, excitement, and investment to the narrative. Combat is represented in-game by <b>encounters</b>, when the Players are <i>encountering</i> a challenge. It doesn't always have to be physical violence, but it must be a true test of the characters' abilities and the Player's problem solving skills.</p>

            <h4>Initiative</h4>
            <p>When an encounter begins, the Players will roll <b>dexterity checks</b> for each character they command and the Game Master will do the same for each type of enemy involved in the encounter. The highest roll goes first, followed by second highest, etc. When the order is set, the character or creature with the highest roll get to take their turn by attacking or taking an action, whatever they want. If a character or creature has the element of surprise, they can attack <i>before</i> the initiative roll.</p>

            <h3>Attacking</h3>
            <p>Attacks can be done with unarmed strikes, weapons, spells, curses, summoned creatures, thrown objects... whatever the character or creature pleases.  First the attacker will make an attack roll using a d20, applying their appropriate ability score modifier. There are different conditions depending on the nature of the attack, however.</p>

            <h4>Physical Strikes</h4>
            <p>If the attack is a close to medium range physical strike with a sword, club, staff, pole, dagger, wrench, etc. then the attacker compares their attack roll against the target's armor class (AC). If the result is higher than their AC, then the attack hits and the attacker rolls their weapon's damage dice to see how much damage the target will take. If the result is lower than their AC, the attack fails and play continues to the next character or creature in the order.</p>

            <h4>Saving Throws</h4>
            <p>Successful physical strikes cannot normally be defended against, but ranged attacks like arrows, spells, or bullets require the target to roll a <b>d20</b> for a saving throw, basically a dodge, and add the appropriate ability score modifier. If the resulting saving throw is higher than the attack roll, the target successfully evades the attack. Saving throws can also be used to avoid environmental dangers and traps, set in place by the Game Master.</p>

            <h3>Combat Table</h3>
            <p>The following are examples of different ability score modifiers an attacker would apply and saving throws a target would roll, depending on the kind of attack being made:</p>
            <table class="table">

            <h3 id="health">Health</h3>
            <p>All characters and creatures have another number that represents their health, called <b>hit points</b>. Your character's max hit points is the amount of damage they can sustain before going unconcious and eventually dying.</p>
            <p>Characters lost hit points from successful enemy attacks but can also revive hit points for themselves and/or others with special moves, first aid kits, health potions, or good old rest (outside of combat, of course).</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="death">Death</h3>
            <p>When a character's HP is reduced to zero the character is <b>unconcious</b>. The Player has 3 <i>death saving throws</i> as a way for their character to cling to life and give their party members a chance to heal them and bring them back from the brink. Healing may or may not wake them, but the character will no longer be dying. If the Player manages to roll 3 saves (3 rolls higher than 10) the character wakes with 1HP. If they fail all 3 saving throws before their party can stabilize them, they die.</p>

            <p>Some Game Masters may allow for an afterlife of some kind as a way to keep the Player in the game or allow the Player to create a new character to bring in on the next quest, but it's recommended that ghost characters not be given corporeal power or a means to speak with the party unless a party member has a special move that allows them to do so. If death isn't a punishment then there's no risk in combat!</p>

            <p class="well">Game Masters: Make character death satisfying or temporary if you want to keep an amicable relationship with your Players.</p>

            <p>Make sure you try and at least loosely match your character with the world your Game Master has created!</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="hitPoints">Hit Points</h3>
            <p>Your character's hit points (HP) represent the amount of damage they can take before they fall unconcious and must start to roll their death saving throws. At level 1, your character's HP will be the same as their constitution score. Every time you level up you will roll a d10, add your constitution modifier, and add the result to your max HP.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="equip">Equipment</h3>
            <p>Every character will have equipment they carry with them, mainly their weapons, armor, and other assorted gear.</p>

            <h4>Main Weapon</h4>
            <p>You character's <b>main weapon</b> is their main mode of action in encounters. It can be a baseball bat, a broadsword, a healing staff, a blessed silver acoustic guitar with the name "Heather" written across it in hot-pink glitter... whatever you want. Every weapon will have a <b>name</b>, a <b>description</b> of the weapon's appearance and extra attributes, and a <b>type</b>, which determines the die you will roll should you land an attack with it.</p>
            <p>Extra attributes are essentially the special conditions or powers of your weapon; maybe it glows when a special type of enemy is nearby, or it has advantage in certain weather. Extra attributes are also where you'll describe magical weapon's attacks, like a wand that shoots fireballs, and the special conditions created by the attack if any (+2 damage against wood and flesh, -2 damage against water-based creatures).</p>

            <h4>Sub Weapon</h4>
            <p>Some characters will carry a shield, others will carry a bow or some other ranged weapon, and others still will just carry another head-basher to rush in dual-weild style. The secondary weapon, or <b>sub weapon</b> helps add an extra element to your character.</p>

            <h4>Armor</h4>
            <p>The <b>armor</b> section of the character sheet describes your character's clothing and garbs. If your character decides to wear some kind of protective gear, be it steel armor or elbow pads, you'll give it a <b>name</b> and <b>description</b> here, along with giving it a <b>type</b>. Keep in mind that there are penalties to heavier armors, but the protection they provide can definitely improve your character's chances of defending against attacks. Below are the armor types and their benefits/penalties.</p>

                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

            <h4>Gear</h4>
            <p>Your character's <b>gear</b> is just the extra equipment or magical items they carry. It could be survival gear, research tools, thieving tools, camping gear, etc. Try to reflect your character's daily needs in the gear they carry and don't forget that you can make use of their gear during the quests. Perhaps they collected a shining ruby from a swamp cave, you'll add that to their gear. Keep track of what your character's are holding, it can come in handy.</p>

            <h3 id="spMoves">Special Moves</h3>
            <p>Rather than fuss around with complicated skill trees, spells, feats, domains, and combat maneuvers, <b>House Rules RPG</b> keeps it simple by giving every character 8 <b>special moves</b>. Special moves can be spells, combat techniques, tactics, powers, abilities, attacks, or other special actions that your character can take. When designing your character's special moves, think about actions that are unique to their body or mind. A reptilian character might have a venomous bite as a special move, where a healing-based character might have an assortment of surgical techniques. Each character will be different and will have a different power curve to consider.</p>
