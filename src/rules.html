            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>House Rules RPG is a tool for building custom tabletop <b>role-playing games</b>, in which Players create and guide characters through a fictional world, built and controlled by the Game Master. The Players interact with the world by <b>taking actions</b> and engaging enemies in <b>combat</b>. Non-player characters (NPCs) are controlled by the Game Master and give the Players clues to help them progress through the events they’ve prepared.</p>

            <h4>To play House Rules RPG, you’ll need:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>A Game Master with a <b>quest</b></li>
              <li>At least 1 Player with a <b>character</b></li>
              <li>A dice set (or simulator)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Thankfully, this website provides a <a href="character.html">character sheet creator</a>, a <a href="quest.html">quest writing tool</a>, and a dice simulator for you.</p>

            <h3 id="useDiceSim">Using the Dice Simulator</h3>
            <p>House Rules RPG provides a dice simulator on the <a href="character.html">Character</a> and <a href="quest.html">Quest</a> pages, in the upper-right hand corner of the header. Simply click the “Dice Sim” button to open the dice simulator panel and click the "Roll" button to generate a random number between 1 and 20. You can also check the radio button next to "Other" and use the inputs to set the amount and type of dice you want to roll.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="saving">Saving Characters and Quests</h3>
            <p>You can use the <a href="character.html">Character</a> and <a href="quest.html">Quest</a> pages on this website to create, save, and update your character sheets and quest outlines. In a moment you’ll learn more about building a character and how to use the character creator, but first, two warnings.</p>

            <p>First, as you may have read on the homepage of this site, House Rules RPG saves character and quest data to your browser’s “localStorage”. <i>We do not externally save, and cannot access, your data.</i> If your localStorage is cleared, <b>you will lose your character/quest data</b>. You also will only be able to load your data from the browser that they were created on. Depending on your browser, your localStorage will not be cleared unless you clear your cookies and website data, but we understand that sometimes it’s necessary, so be warned.</p>

            <p>Second, your Game Master will need a copy of your character sheet, so you can either:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Print two hard copies of your character sheet, keep one, and give your GM a copy to keep in their campaign folder, or</li>
              <li>“Print” your character sheet as a PDF file to save it as a document on your computer. Then you can share it with your GM and view it from any of your devices, and if your browser data is cleared you won’t lose your character.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This is House Rules RPG v1.0. <b>If there is a high enough demand for it</b>, we will continue to improve this site by adding user accounts, secured saves for characters and quests, and possibly a community section for finding and connecting with other players. However, this started as a free, simple, custom RPG tool and web development practice project and until there’s evidence that the system works well and enough people want those features, the site will remain as is.</p>

            <p class="text-left">Tweet with the hashtag <b>#HRRPG</b> or send me an email about your experiences with House Rules RPG at <a href="mailto:spookedram@gmail.com?Subject=House%20Rules%20RPG" target="_blank">spookedram@gmail.com</a>, and let me know if those features are something you’d like to see.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="firstSession">The First Session</h3>
            <p>First you have to find people to play with. You can do a solo quest with 1 Player and a Game Master, or a bigger party with many Players (although we recommend <b>no more than 6</b> or you’ll find a simple quest ends up taking multiple sessions). The first session you have should be a round-table discussion about the kind of game you want to play and laying down your own personal rules about how to handle touchy subjects like character death, re-rolls, and rule challenges. Write them down and bring them to the session! Pick at least a vague genre, or agree to a completely random open-world, so that you can create quests and characters that don't conflict too badly. This first session is not for jumping in and playing your first quest, although there are sample characters and quests you can use if you'd rather jump right in instead of crafting a personalized experience.</p>

            <h4>Pick a Genre</h4>
            <p>Do you want your game to be classic fantasy? Space-faring sci-fi? Post-apocalyptic? Superheroes? Ancient Greek mythology? Lovecraftian? Talk about your interests and look to games, books, movies, and tv shows to get inspired! Or, maybe you’ll leave it up to your Game Master to craft the world and focus more on creating interesting characters. Whatever you choose, make sure your party is on the same page.</p>

            <h4>House Rules</h4>
            <p>Most tabletop RPG gaming groups develop something called <i>house rules</i> to work around unnecessarily complicated or unfair rules. There are some parts of House Rules RPG that will differ from party to party as well, house rules that you’ll decide on as a group.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>How will your party handle unfairness, inappropriate behavior, or broken rules?</li>
              <li>Will you allow perks that give someone else control of your character via mind control or possession?</li>
              <li>How will your party handle character death? Will there be ghosts or some other afterlife? Is there a chance for a character to be revived or are they gone forever and their Player has to rejoin with a new character?</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Rule Challenges</h4>
            <p>Sometimes people make mistakes. Sometimes a perk turns out to be game-breakingly powerful. Sometimes your Game Master will go mad, flip the table, and send your characters straight into a volcano. It's important to know ahead of time what's acceptable and what's not, and how your party will deal with the unacceptable. <b>Seek to compromise</b> where you can; if your character is blasting through every enemy like tissue paper, maybe you and your Game Master can set up a situation to narratively hinder them, weaken them, bring them back to equal footing with the rest of the party. If your Players have all had to roll death saving throws for 15 minutes, maybe you overestimated their combat skills and need to intervene for the sake of the story (and your relationships with your Players).</p>

            <p>House Rules RPG is <b>by no means a perfect system</b>, especially since it puts most of the actual responsibility in your hands, but it's also supposed to be fun! It's a game, try not to hurt each other and work around the broken parts of the game as they come up.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="actions">Understanding Actions</h3>
            <p>When in-game, characters interact with the world and the NPCs by <b>taking actions</b>. Basically, a Player will tell the Game Master what they want their character to do and the Game Master will decide if it’s a <b>free action</b> or if it requires a <b>difficulty check</b>. Depending on the Game Master’s opinion, one of two things can happen.</p>

            <h4>Free Actions</h4>
            <p>Actions that don’t require skill or aren't that difficult, like speaking bluntly or opening an unlocked door, are free actions and will not require the Player to roll a <b>difficulty check</b>.</p>

            <h4>Difficulty Checks</h4>
            <p>Throwing a knife to cut a swinging rope, disarming a ticking time bomb, and summoning an unknowable beast from another dimension are a lot more difficult than opening an unlocked door. Actions with any level of difficulty require a <b>difficulty check (DC)</b>. If the Game Master decides that the action will require a difficulty check, they will first decide what ability the action will use and then pick a number that represents the action’s difficulty. Then the Player <b>rolls a d20</b> and adds or subtracts the required <b>ability score modifier</b>. If the result is higher than the action’s DC, the character succeeds, and if it is lower or equal to the action’s DC, the character fails. For example:</p>

            <blockquote>
              Player: "I want to use my new lockpick on the cage."<br>
              GM: "Alright, roll a <b>dexterity check</b>."<br>
              GM (thinking): <i>Probably a DC of 14...</i><br>
              Player: "Nice! I rolled a 16!"<br>
              GM: "You pick the lock... and inside you find a sleeping circus bear."
            </blockquote>

            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> It can take some practice to put a number to an action's difficulty, but remember, Game Masters, that your party can sometimes combine rolls to give the more difficult actions the advantage of teamwork. For instance, lifting a truck could take a strength roll of 40, requiring a number of party members or NPCs to help out.</p>

            <h4>Critical Rolls</h4>
            <p>If you roll for a difficulty check or an attack and it lands on 1, the result is a <b>critical miss</b>. On the other hand, if you roll a natural 20, that is, a 20 without modifiers, the result is a <b>critical hit</b> and the action is an instant success. The intensity of the action is between you and the Game Master to decide; the Player narrates their character taking the action and the Game Master narrates the result or effect.</p>

            <h4>Advantage/Disadvantage</h4>
            <p>Sometimes a character or NPC will find themselves in a position where the Game Master will decide to give them <b>advantage</b> or <b>disadvantage</b> on a particular roll. If the person rolling has advantage, they can roll twice and keep the <b>higher roll</b>. If they have disadvantage, they roll twice and keep the <b>lower roll</b>. Advantage/disadvantage is a powerful tool for controlling probability and should be <b>used sparingly</b>, and only if the situation calls for it.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="gmEtiquette">Game Master Etiquette</h3>
            <p>Game Masters, remember that you may have crafted the settings and events of the quest but your Player's characters are the ones who are living inside it. <b>Do not</b> make big decisions for them and try not to force them into dangerous situations without warning signs. It's better to drop subtle clues and let the Players guide themselves through the quest, offering a nudge in the right direction only occasionally.</p>

          <div class="tab-pane" id="characters" style="display:none;">
            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p>Every Player is going to need at least 1 character that they can control in the game. Players can use the <a href="character.html">Character</a> page on this site to create their character sheet, and the Game Master can use it to design the NPCs that the Players will interact with.</p>

            <h3 id="archetypes">Character Archetypes</h3>
            <p>House Rules RPG encourages creativity and boundary-breaking gameplay, but it can help to have somewhere to start. These are the basic combat archetypes found in most RPGs. A well-balanced team will fill at least 4 different combat roles, but don't feel obligated to follow these roles exactly. Branch out, forge your own path, each party configuration and quest will have it's own unique challenges that can't be foreseen.</p>

            <h3 id="level">Level</h3>
            <p>If you’re starting from scratch with a new group, it’s best to leave your level at 1. However, if you’re recreating a character, updating a character, or creating an NPC for a quest with characters higher than level 1 you can change this as needed.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="hp">Hit Points (HP)</h3>
            <p>Hit points, or HP, represent the number of hits your character can take before they fall unconscious and have to start rolling death saving throws (explained later). At level 1 your character’s HP is the same as their vitality ability score, and their max HP increases every time they level up.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="abilities">Ability Scores</h3>
            <p>Every character and creature in House Rules RPG has 7 ability scores, represented by a number between 1 and 20. Ability scores are more than just your character’s base stats, they’re used to give your character advantages and disadvantages when rolling for different kinds of actions in the game. These 7 abilities are:</p>

                  <th>Vitality<br>(VIT)</th>
                  <td>Represents health, stamina, and endurance. Vitality is used when increasing your character’s max HP after gaining a level, but it’s also checked when an action affects your character’s health, stamina, or endurance.</td>

                  <td>Represents willpower, common sense, and intuition. Wisdom is used when a character is applying faith, will, and guts. Wisdom is also used for spells and skills that were learned by training, rather than reading.</td>

                  <th>Perception<br>(PER)</th>
                  <td>Represents senses and awareness. Perception is used when a character will need to "notice" something odd, significant, or dangerous around them. This can come from a trap ready to spring, a hidden enemy, or a clue hidden in a room. Characters who are undetected will become detected when another character or enemy makes a successful perception check.</td>

              </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Characters start with 10 points on each score, because 10 points means 0 modifier. Each number greater or less than 10 adds a positive or negative modifier, used in difficulty checks. For example:</p>

            <blockquote>
              Player: "Can Killgrog understand the hieroglyphs?"<br>
              GM: "Go ahead and make an intelligence check."<br>
              Player: "Uh oh, he's isn't exactly a genius..."<br>
              GM: "You can try and roll anyway."<br>
              Player: "I rolled a 10, but his INT score is 7, so minus 3..."<br>
              GM: "Yeah, that failed."<br>
              Killgrog: "It's a butterscotch recipe!"
            </blockquote>

            <p>When you make your character, consider taking points from areas where they are weak and placing those points on abilities where they are strong. That way, when your character makes difficulty checks, they're more likely to succeed at actions they're good at and more likely to fail at actions they're bad at. We recommend going no lower than 7 and no higher than 18 on any one ability, at least to start; you never know when a brawler will need to make an intelligence roll to save his team.</p>

            <h4>Main Weapon</h4>
            <p>You character's main weapon is their main mode of action during encounters. It can be a baseball bat, a broadsword, a healing staff, a blessed silver acoustic guitar with the name "Heather" written across it in hot-pink glitter... whatever you want. Every weapon will have a name, a description of the weapon's appearance and extra attributes, and a type, which determines the amount and type of dice you will roll to deal damage after landing a successful attack. Every few levels your character will add a dice to their weapon damage, as seen on the table below:</p>

            <h4>Sub Weapon</h4>
            <p>Some characters will carry a shield, others will carry a bow or some other ranged weapon, and others still will just carry another head-basher to rush in dual-wield style. Your character’s secondary weapon, or sub weapon helps add an extra element to your character, and also has a name, description, and type.</p>

            <p><b>Animal Companions</b><br>As a quick side note, your character might have an animal companion that fights alongside them in combat. You can add an animal companion to your character in place of the character’s sub weapon. Different sized animals will have different weapon types: cats are small, birds are ranged, dogs are medium, bears are large, and as strange as it sounds, if your animal fits the use of a shield, like a massive turtle, it could also have that type.</p>

            <h4>Armor</h4>
            <p>Every character and creature in House Rules RPG has an armor class that represents how well protected they are. If your character decides to wear some kind of protective gear, be it steel armor or elbow pads, you'll give it a name and description here, along with giving it a type. Keep in mind that there are penalties to heavier armors, but the protection they provide can definitely improve your character's chances of defending against attacks. Below are the armor types and their benefits/penalties:</p>

            <table class="table">
              <thead>
                <th>Type</th>

                  <td>If your character is wearing regular clothing, a hazmat suit, or nothing at all, they have an armor type of <i>none</i>.</td>

                  <td>If your character is wearing bulletproof gear or partial steel/iron armor, they have an armor type of <i>medium</i>.</td>
                  <td>+4 to AC, -2 to initiative rolls</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Heavy (AC 16)</td>
                  <td>If your character is wearing dragon bones, a riot suit, or full steel/iron armor, they have an armor type of <i>heavy</i>.</td>
                  <td>+6 to AC, -4 to initiative rolls</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

            <h4>Gear</h4>
            <p>Your character's gear section is for the extra equipment or magical items they carry. It could be survival gear, research tools, thieving tools, camping gear, etc. The gear section is also where you'll add mementos and important nostalgic items from your character's past, provided they carry it on them at all times. Try to reflect your character's daily needs in the gear they carry and don't forget that you can make use of their gear during the quests. Keep track of what your characters are holding, they can come in handy.</p>

            <h4>Extra Attributes</h4>
            <p>Extra attributes are essentially the special conditions or powers that a weapon, a set of armor, or an item possesses. Maybe it glows when a special type of enemy is nearby, or it does +1 damage in certain weather. The object could protect against or enhance a certain kind of attack. An example would be a wand that shoots lightning; you'd describe the wand first and add something like "Allows wielder to fire a lightning bolt at a target for 1d8 electric damage." The wand would still be a Small (d4) weapon, but when used correctly it will do the same damage as a Medium (d8) weapon.</p>

            <p>Extra attributes are useful for leveraging a character's INT and WIS scores, specifically for magic users, but can also help rogue-type characters who have poison darts, for instance. Extra Attributes must be approved by the Game Master and/or the rest of the party before you play. It's not fair for you character to pull out a pocketwatch they inherited from their grandfather during a fight and claim that his ghost can be summoned to fight alongside you, unless your Game Master knew about it and allowed it ahead of time.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="details">Details</h3>
            <p>In the <b>details</b> section you'll fill out your character’s appearance, personality, and backstory. You can be as vague or as specific as you'd like, but try to at least include important, game-relevant details.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="perks">Perks</h3>
            <p>Most tabletop RPGs fuss around with complicated skill trees, spells, feats, domains, and combat maneuvers, but House Rules RPG keeps it simple by giving each character 8 perks. Perks are special actions your character can take thanks to their body, mind, background, training, studies, and growth. Perks can be spells, combat techniques or tactics, magic powers, or professional skills.</p>

            Perk Types Table

            <p><b>AoE</b><br>
              Some perks affect an area rather than a specific target. An example of an AoE (area of effect) perk would be a ninja dropping spikes to impede her pursuers, a cleric healing his allies as long as their close to him for a few rounds, or a mage casting a lava spell on a specific area of the environment.</p>

            <h4>Using Perks</h4>
            <p>To use a perk, the Player will roll a difficulty check with the appropriate modifier to see if the perk action was successful, if not they still lose the use for that day. When designing your character's perks, think about actions that are unique to their body or mind. A reptilian character might have a venomous bite as a perk, where as a healing-based character might have an assortment of restorative techniques. Each character will be different and will have a different power curve to consider.</p>

            <h4>Perks by Level</h4>
            <p>Characters start with 2 perks and unlock a new one every 3 levels.</p>

            <h3 id="levelUp">Leveling Up</h3>
            <p>Your character’s level represents their progress and their power within the world. Character usually <b>gain a level</b> at the end of a significant quest or story arc, and each new level comes with rewards. First, every time a character levels up, their Player will <b>roll a d10</b>, add their character's <b>vitality modifier</b>, and add the result to <b>increase their max hit points</b> (if their vitality modifier brings the result into the negatives, add only 1 to their max hit points). Depending on the level your character is gaining, you might also <b>unlock a new perk</b>, gain a new <b>point</b> to add to an <b>ability</b> of your choice, or gain a <b>die</b> to add to your <b>weapon damage</b>. Your character also receives some <b>gold</b> that can be used to purchase new equipment and items.</p>

            <h4>Buying Items</h4>
            <p>Whether or not your party will get gold to spend on magic items after leveling up is something you should discuss in the first session. It can take some extra time to come up with magic items to sell, but there's lots of places to go for inspiration. Consider what kinds of items could be <b>useful</b> in-game: things that enable communication, protection, traversal, disguise, or power over the elements are a few ideas. You can have one-use items that give <b>advantage</b> to certain rolls or <b>add a point to a modifier</b> when used, or you could just have various interesting garbs and armors just for appearance. It's up to you and your party, be creative and <b>have fun with it</b>!</p>

            <h2>Combat</h2>
            <h3 id="init">Initiative</h3>
            <p>If a conflict devolves into violence, you've entered combat, and combat starts with everyone <b>rolling for initiative</b>. Each character and type of enemy will make a <b>DEX difficulty check</b>. The character or enemy type with the highest roll is at the top of the order and the character or enemy type with the lowest roll is at the bottom. The first round starts with the top of the order’s first turn.</p>

            <h4>Surprise Round</h4>
            <p>If a character or creature is undetected, they can take a turn to attack a target <b>before the initiative roll</b>, as a surprise round.</p>

            <h3 id="turns">Turns</h3>
            <p>A <b>turn</b> is a character or creature's <i>turn</i> to fight. They get to make <b>1 movement</b> and <b>1 action</b> (in that order) before the next person in the initiative order gets their turn. A movement is changing position, drawing a weapon, reloading a bow/gun, or using a movement-based perk. An action could be attacking a target, casting a spell, or using an action-based perk. You can only use <b>1 perk per turn</b>. A character or creature can also decide to either make a movement and skip their action or skip their movement and only take an action, if they want.</p>

            <h3 id="rounds">Rounds</h3>
            <p>One <b>round</b> of combat represents roughly <b>6 seconds</b> in the game world. One round is everyone in the order getting their turn, moving, taking actions and attacking, defending and making saving throws. Once it's back to the first in the order it's a new round. Combat moves quickly but, if it's going too long, the Players and Game Master can always look for other options, like running away.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="attacks">Attacking</h3>
            <p>Attacks can be made with unarmed strikes, weapons, spells, curses, summoned creatures, thrown objects... whatever the character or creature pleases. Attacks are just actions, so the Player will make a difficulty check by <b>rolling a d20</b> and applying the appropriate <b>ability score modifier</b>. The difference between an action and an attack is that attacks are always checked against the target’s <b>armor class</b>.</p>

            <p>If the attack is a close to mid-range <b>physical strike</b> with a sword, club, staff, pole, dagger, wrench, etc. and the attack hits, the attacker rolls their weapon's <b>damage dice</b> to see how many hit points the target loses. If the result is lower than their AC, the attack fails and play continues to the next character or creature in the order.</p>

            <h4>Saving Throws</h4>
            <p>Successful physical strikes cannot be defended against (unless the target has a perk that allows them to parry or dodge), but ranged attacks like arrows, spells, or bullets require the target to <b>roll a d20</b> for a <b>saving throw</b>, basically a dodge, and add the appropriate <b>ability score modifier</b>. If the resulting saving throw is higher than the attack roll, the target successfully evades the attack. If not, the attacker deals damage.</p>

            <h3 id="death">Death</h3>
            <p>When a character's HP is <b>reduced to zero</b> the character <b>falls unconscious</b>. The Player has 3 <b>death saving throws</b> (using a d20 with no modifier) as a way for their character to cling to life and give their party members a chance to heal them and bring them back from the brink. <i>Healing may or may not wake them, but the character will no longer be dying.</i> If the Player manages to roll <b>3 saves</b> (3 rolls higher than 10) and the character hasn't been healed, they wake with 1d6 HP. If they fail all 3 saving throws before their party can stabilize them, <b>they die</b>.</p>

            <p>Some Game Masters may allow for an afterlife of some kind as a way to keep the Player in the game or allow the Player to create a new character to bring in on the next quest, but it's recommended that ghost characters not be given corporeal power or a means to speak with the party unless a party member has a perk that allows them to do so. If death isn't a punishment then there's no risk to combat!</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> Game Masters, make character death satisfying or temporary if you want to maintain an amicable relationship with your Players.</p>

            <h2>Quests</h2>
            <h3>Sample Quests</h3>
            <p>There are several example quests on the Quest Save/Load panel that you can use as a starting point. Simply click the Save/Load button, select the example quest you want to view from the dropdown list, and click the load button! Then you can tweak the quest to fit your needs or simply use it to gain a better understanding of what to write in each box.</p>

            <h3 id="theme">Writing Quests</h3>
            <p>The Game Master is, for all intents and purposes, the lead storyteller. They set up the world, the non-player characters, and the events that the Players will trigger by traversing through, and interacting with, the setting. To be an effective Game Master you must know how to set up compelling scenes, puzzles, and encounters for your party and become an actor, breathing life into every NPC (hostile or otherwise) that the Players come across. It's a tough job, but it can be incredibly rewarding.</p>

            <h4>Theme</h4>
            <p>The key to writing a story with depth is to start with a solid theme. A theme is the core idea of the story, what the whole quest will revolve around. In story writing, the theme is the author's argument; it's a core issue that is being viewed through many lenses and perspectives. But at the end, theme also takes a side in the argument, it is the moral of the story. Think of a specific emotion or issue you want to explore, but try to keep it simple and strong. Some examples of themes include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There are no rules in love</li>
              <li>Immortality carries a cost</li>
              <li>In extreme circumstances, stealing is ethical</li>
              <li>Nature is careless and dangerous</li>
              <li>Peace means nothing without justice</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are all arguments, but you could just as easily write quests around the opposites of those ideas. Pick an issue, take a side. Once you have a theme in mind you can start to think about ways to explore the different aspects of it: twist it around and find new perspectives on it and build some scenarios from the results. If you're having trouble coming up with one or you're not sure if what you have is a theme, ask these three questions:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>What is this quest about?</li>
              <li>Why do I want to run this quest?</li>
              <li>Will my Players care about this quest?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> The theme is best used with subtlety; it's not something you're going to announce or talk about with your Players until after the quest is completed. Also understand that the issue you're taking a side on might conflict with one of your Player's beliefs, but this is also an opportunity to engage in discussion and learn about each other.</p>
            <p>If you'd rather stay away from debating or you just want something easy, you can pick something from this list instead:</p>

            <h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
            <p>A change of scenery can easily ramp up the tension or provide a lull between action, something you'll want to take advantage of, but try not to have too many conflicting environments or lots of extraneous travel in one story or you risk confusing or boring your Players. Do you drop your players into a swamp? Are they sneaking through an ancient temple trying to avoid dangerous cultists? Or maybe they're making their way through a decimated version of Manhattan? The number of settings and amount of detail will change depending on your quest, but take some time to consider each one and try to sum it up in a short, clear, descriptive way for your settings list.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="npcs">Non-Player Characters</h3>
            <p>Every good quest has <b>non-player characters (NPCs)</b>, controlled by the Game Master, for the Players to interact with. These are not just the townsfolk and allies, but also the enemies and secret-keepers of the game. A good Game Master will try to breathe life into the NPCs of the quest, giving them unique personalities and voices. They'll hopefully become characters that the Players will get invested in, that they'll love (or love to hate). NPCs will require character sheets as well, although you maybe don't want spend too much time on the details of cannon-fodder enemies.</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> If you're creating an NPC higher than level 1 using the character creator, first set their vitality, then their level, then click the "Update HP" button to simulate adding Hit Points for each level the character has gained. Try to stick with the first or second roll, to simulate the randomness involved in rolling dice for each level.</p>

            <h4>Creating Enemies</h4>
            <p>Simple enemies don't need a full character sheet, though you can still use the Character Creator to build them. You can shortcut the process: when creating and writing a simple enemy into the quest, only include their name, level, modifiers (only ones that would affect rolls), HP, AC, weapon damage, and no more than 3 perks.</p>
            <b>Examples:</b>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h4>Level 4 Hobgoblin</h4>
                <p>STR +1 / DEX +1 / CHA -2<br>
                  HP 23 / AC 12 / DMG 2d8<br>
                  <b>Perks</b><br>
                  <i>Lick Wounds:</i> 3d8 HP healing<br>
                  <i>Cutpurse:</i> DC 14 DEX to steal 100g from target.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h4>Level 14 Nightstalker</h4>
                <p>STR +3 / DEX +1 / VIT +3 / INT -2<br>
                  HP 117 / AC 10 / DMG 5d4<br>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> When designing perks for enemies, use perks closer to their level. You can decide to include a description if the name doesn't describe the effects well enough.</p>

            <h3 id="rAndP">Rhythm and Pacing</h3>
            <p>An engaging story has everything to do with <b>pacing</b>. Knowing when and how to raise the stakes and release the tension to let your Players breathe is crucial to creating a satisfying experience. Too much tension for too long and your Players will go numb waiting for a break. Not enough and your story is boring. Oscillating between moments of action and moments of rest gives your Players time to process and regroup, to get perspective and put the stakes into proper context. The quest writing tool can help you pace out events in your quest to maintain a good rhythm of <b>highs and lows.</b></p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <p>Sometimes a quest needs a little narration up front to set the scene, introduce some NPCs, and ease the Players into the world and put the quest into perspective. Not every quest will require this level of easing though, some will start off with a bang! If that's the case, skip the setup and jump straight into setting the goal.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="act1">Act One</h3>
            <h4>High - Goal Set</h4>
            <p>Every quest has an <b>end goal</b>. Whether or not the climax and resolution have anything to do with the original goal is irrelevant, what matters is that the party starts their quest with a <b>specific purpose</b>. This is a one-sentence call to action that sums up the reason the party is taking action. Are they after a large amount of treasure? Have they been contracted to stop a group of kidnappers? Maybe they must prove their innocence after being falsely (or rightly) accused of murder. Whatever it is, your Players must be given a <i>clear goal</i> to strive towards. Keep the theme in mind when writing the goal.</p>

            <h4>Low - Wandering</h4>
            <p>For the first real stretch of the story, the Players should be in charge. They'll be the ones deciding where to go and who to talk to, and the Game Master will be reacting by giving out small hints and subtly guiding them towards the first encounter, the first peak in tension, that will hopefully remind them of the cost of failure.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 id="act2">Act Two</h3>
            <h4>High - Fun Fight</h4>
            <p>The first true encounter of the story should be a chance for Players to stretch their role playing muscles. It must be higher tension than a simple investigation or traversal, but it should also be less of a challenge than what's to come. Your Players want to feel powerful, they want to use the new skills and weapons at their disposal, and this first encounter should satisfy that desire.</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Combat:</b> Stick to enemies lower than your party's level. Consider multiples and make it fun by adding in an interesting element; maybe they're fighting in sinking sand or they have to finish in a certain number of rounds before the police arrive.</p>

            <h4>Low - The Twist</h4>
            <p>Something about the quest is wrong. Somebody is lying, something else is brewing, and the initial threat is much more powerful or complicated than what was first thought. The twist is the moment where the Players realize that <b>the goal isn't quite what they thought it was</b>. Lead them into the twist or reveal it in a moment of instant revelation, but don't give away the whole secret just yet.</p>

            <h4>High - The Challenge</h4>
            <p>This encounter should be a real test of the Player’s combat and problem solving skills. It's a heightened reminder of the cost of failure but it's also a reminder that the characters have still come far. Make it difficult, make it hurt, but make sure that the characters will come out the other end stronger, or at least more cautious, than they were when they started.</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Combat:</b> Try some enemies on an equal level to your Player's characters. You can make it interesting with a chase sequence or some environmental obstacles.</p>

            <h4>Low - The Search Ends</h4>
            <p>This is the turning point, the beginning of the end. The characters have been stumbling around after the test and are collecting the last few clues they need to unravel the mystery. This event is <b>the big reveal</b>. Lead them right to the edge and drop the truth bomb, lure them in and then force them right into the last stretch running.</p>

            <h3 id="act4">Act Four</h3>
            <h4>High - The Climax</h4>
            <p>The final battle, the last encounter of the quest. This will be <i>the most difficult challenge for the Players yet</i>, it will test their skills and push them to the limit. The risk is the highest it's been, but the payoff is huge. This is the time to pull out all the stops.<p>

            <p class="well"><b>Combat:</b> It's the final battle; at least 1 enemy should be a few levels higher than your Player's characters. Add some minions or dangerous (but not all-powerful) perks.</p>

            <h4>Low - Epilogue</h4>
            <p>With the threat subdued and the quest at its end, this last little lull is for the characters to collect their spoils, say their goodbyes, level up, and rest before the next quest begins. Give them time to <b>wrap up the story</b> and put a bow on it, time to feel the satisfaction of the win or to let the grief and loss from the quest settle in, or both.<p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Cliffhanger (Optional)</h3>
            <p>With the quest at its end you may wish to give your Players a <i>taste of what's brewing on the horizon</i>, which you can include in the form of a <b>cliffhanger</b>. Give them just enough of a morsel to get them excited for the next session.<p>

            <h3 id="transition">Transition</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you may want to take a session to regroup and give your Players a rest themselves. It helps to think of sessions as high points, once in awhile you need to let them breathe and adjust their course. Give them low-risk interactions and provide moments where they can dig deeper into their characters thoughts and feelings, moments to build their characters into more complete forms.</p>

            <p>For example, you can give your characters time to visit past victories, take a trip home to see their family, or to reflect on their losses. Let it be a reminder of why they’re going on these quests. This can also be a good place to <b>switch out party members</b>; you can give their character a peaceful, satisfying ending rather than just letting them vanish out of thin air.</p>
