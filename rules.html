            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>House Rules RPG is a tool for building custom tabletop <b>role-playing games</b>, in which Players create and guide characters through a fictional world, built and controlled by the Game Master. The Players interact with the world by <b>taking actions</b> and engaging enemies in <b>combat</b>. Non-player characters (NPCs) are controlled by the Game Master and give the Players clues to help them progress through the quest they’ve prepared.</p>

            <h4>To play House Rules RPG, you’ll need:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>A Game Master with a <b>quest</b></li>
              <li>At least 1 Player with a <b>character</b></li>
              <li>A dice set (or simulator)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Thankfully, this website provides a <a href="character.html">character sheet creator</a>, a <a href="quest.html">quest writing tool</a>, and a dice simulator for you.</p>

            <h3 id="useDiceSim">Using the Dice Simulator</h3>
            <p>House Rules RPG provides a dice simulator on the <a href="character.html">Character</a> and <a href="quest.html">Quest</a> pages, in the upper-right hand corner of the header. Simply click the “Dice Sim” button to open the dice simulator panel and click the "Roll" button to generate a random number between 1 and 20. You can also check the radio button next to "Other" and use the inputs to set the amount and type of dice you want to roll.</p>

            <span id="saving" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Saving Characters and Quests</h3>
            <p>You can use the <a href="character.html">Character</a> and <a href="quest.html">Quest</a> pages on this website to create, save, and update your character sheets and quest outlines. In a moment you’ll learn more about building a character and how to use the character creator, but first, two warnings.</p>

            <p>First, as you may have read on the homepage of this site, House Rules RPG saves character and quest data to your browser’s “localStorage”. <i>I do not externally save, and cannot access, your data.</i> If your localStorage is cleared, <b>you will lose your character/quest data</b>. You also will only be able to load your content from the browser that it was created on. Depending on your browser, your localStorage will not be cleared unless you clear your cookies and website data, but I understand that sometimes it’s necessary, so be warned.</p>

            <p>Second, your Game Master will need either a physical or digital copy of your character sheet. To do this, I recommend using the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-print"></span> Print button to save your content as a PDF and emailing a copy to your Game Master. Even if you're using your smartphone or tablet, there are options for saving, accessing, and sharing your content.</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Print to PDF on a mobile device:</b> If you have an iOS 10 device you can pinch outward on the print preview to save and share the document as a PDF. For android devices, Chrome has Google Cloud Print which you can use to print webpages to a PDF. There are also plenty of mobile apps that provide this functionality. Once you have the PDF, you can keep it in a secure folder and share it with you Game Master.</p>

            <p>House Rules RPG is a free, simple, custom RPG tool is mostly a labor of love and web development practice. I understand that there are quirks with the way I handled content saving, and in the future I may update and add new features, but it's likely the site will remain as is.</p>

            <p class="text-left">Tweet with the hashtag <b>#HRRPG</b> or send me an email about your experiences with House Rules RPG at <a href="mailto:spookedram@gmail.com?Subject=House%20Rules%20RPG" target="_blank">spookedram@gmail.com</a>, and let me know if those features are something you’d like to see.</p>

            <hr>

            <span id="firstSession" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>The First Session</h3>
            <p>First you have to find people to play with. You can do a solo quest with 1 Player and a Game Master, or a bigger party with many Players (although I recommend <b>no more than 6</b> or you’ll find a simple quest ends up taking multiple sessions). The first session you have should be a <b>round-table discussion</b> about the <b>kind of game</b> you want to play and laying down your own <b>personal rules</b> about how to handle touchy subjects like character death, re-rolls, and <b>rule challenges</b>. Write them down and bring them to the session! Pick at least a vague genre, or agree to a completely random open-world, so that you can create quests and characters that don't conflict too badly. This first session is not for jumping in and playing your first quest, although there are sample characters and quests you can use if you'd rather jump right in instead of crafting a personalized experience.</p>

            <h4>Pick a Genre</h4>
            <p>Do you want your game to be classic fantasy? Space-faring sci-fi? Post-apocalyptic? Superheroes? Ancient Greek mythology? Lovecraftian? Talk about your interests and look to games, books, movies, and tv shows to get inspired! Or, maybe you’ll leave it up to your Game Master to craft the world and focus more on creating interesting characters. Whatever you choose, make sure your party is on the same page.</p>

            <h4>House Rules</h4>
            <p>Most tabletop RPG gaming groups develop something called <i>house rules</i> to work around unnecessarily complicated or unfair rules. There are some parts of House Rules RPG that will differ from party to party as well, house rules that you’ll decide on as a group.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>How will your party handle unfairness, inappropriate behavior, or broken rules?</li>
              <li>Will you allow perks that give someone else control of your character via mind control or possession?</li>
              <li>How will your party handle character death? Will there be ghosts or some other afterlife? Is there a chance for a character to be revived or are they gone forever and their Player has to rejoin with a new character?</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Rule Challenges</h4>
            <p>Sometimes people make mistakes. Sometimes a perk turns out to be game-breakingly powerful. Sometimes your Game Master will go mad, flip the table, and send your characters straight into a volcano. It's important to know ahead of time what's acceptable and what's not, and how your party will deal with the unacceptable. <b>Seek to compromise</b> where you can; if your character is blasting through every enemy like tissue paper, maybe you and your Game Master can set up a situation to narratively hinder them, weaken them, bring them back to equal footing with the rest of the party. If your Players have all had to roll death saving throws for 15 minutes, maybe you overestimated their combat skills and need to intervene for the sake of the story (and your relationships with your Players).</p>

            <p>House Rules RPG is <b>by no means a perfect system</b>, especially since it puts most of the actual responsibility in your hands, but it's also supposed to be fun! It's a game, try not to hurt each other and work around the broken parts of the game as they come up.</p>

            <hr>

            <span id="actions" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Understanding Actions</h3>
            <p>When in-game, characters interact with the world and the NPCs by <b>taking actions</b>. Basically, a Player will tell the Game Master what they want their character to do and the Game Master will decide if it’s a <b>free action</b> or if it requires a <b>difficulty check</b>. Depending on the Game Master’s opinion, one of two things can happen.</p>

            <h4>Free Actions</h4>
            <p>Actions that don’t require skill or aren't that difficult, like speaking bluntly or opening an unlocked door, are <b>free actions</b> and will not require the Player to roll a <b>difficulty check</b>.</p>

            <h4>Difficulty Checks</h4>
            <p>Throwing a knife to cut a swinging rope, disarming a ticking time bomb, and summoning an unknowable beast from another dimension are a lot more difficult than opening an unlocked door. Actions with any level of difficulty require a <b>difficulty check</b>. If the Game Master decides that the action will require a difficulty check, they will first decide what ability the action will use and then pick a number that represents the action’s difficulty challenge (DC). Then the Player <b>rolls a d20</b> and adds or subtracts the required <b>ability score modifier</b>. If the result is higher than or equal to the action’s DC, the character succeeds, and if it is lower than the action’s DC, the character fails. For example:</p>

            <blockquote>
              Player: "I want to use my new lockpick on the cage."<br>
              GM: "Alright, roll a <b>dexterity check</b>."<br>
              GM (thinking): <i>Probably a DC of 14...</i><br>
              Player: "Nice! I rolled a 16!"<br>
              GM: "You pick the lock... and inside you find a sleeping circus bear."
            </blockquote>

            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> It can take some practice to put a number to an action's difficulty, but remember, Game Masters, that your party can sometimes combine rolls to give the more difficult actions the advantage of teamwork. For instance, lifting a truck could take a strength roll of 40, requiring a number of party members or NPCs to help out.</p>

            <h4>Critical Rolls</h4>
            <p>If you roll for a difficulty check or an attack and it lands on 1, the result is a <b>critical miss</b>. On the other hand, if you roll a natural 20, that is, a 20 without modifiers, the result is a <b>critical hit</b> and the action is an instant success. The intensity of the action is between you and the Game Master to decide; the Player narrates their character taking the action and the Game Master narrates the result or effect.</p>

            <h4>Advantage/Disadvantage</h4>
            <p>Sometimes a character or NPC will find themselves in a position where the Game Master will decide to give them <b>advantage</b> or <b>disadvantage</b> on a particular roll. If the person rolling has advantage, they can roll twice and keep the <b>higher roll</b>. If they have disadvantage, they roll twice and keep the <b>lower roll</b>. Advantage/disadvantage is a powerful tool for controlling probability and should be <b>used sparingly</b>, and only if the situation calls for it.</p>

            <hr>

            <span id="gmEtiquette" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Game Master Etiquette</h3>
            <p>Game Masters, remember that you may have crafted the settings and events of the quest but your Player's characters are the ones who are living inside it. <b>Do not</b> make big decisions for them and try not to force them into dangerous situations without warning signs. It's better to drop subtle clues and let the Players guide themselves through the quest, offering a nudge in the right direction only occasionally.</p>

            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p>Every Player is going to need at least 1 character that they can control in the game. Players can use the <a href="character.html">Character</a> page on this site to create their character sheet, and the Game Master can use it to design the NPCs that the Players will interact with.</p>

            <span id="archetypes" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Character Archetypes</h3>
            <p>House Rules RPG encourages creativity and boundary-breaking gameplay, but it can help to have somewhere to start. These are the basic combat archetypes found in most RPGs. A well-balanced team will fill at least 4 different combat roles, but don't feel obligated to follow these roles exactly.

            <span id="level" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Level</h3>
            <p>Your character’s level represents their progress and their power within the world. If you’re starting from scratch with a new group, it’s best to leave your level at 1. However, if you’re recreating a character, updating a character, or creating an NPC for a quest with characters higher than level 1, you can change this as needed.</p>

            <h3>Hit Points (HP)</h3>
            <p>Hit points, or HP, represent the number of hits your character can take before they fall unconscious and have to start rolling death saving throws (explained later). At level 1 your character’s HP is the same as their vitality ability score, and their max HP increases every time they level up.</p>

            <h3>Ability Scores</h3>
            <p>Every character and creature in House Rules RPG has 7 ability scores, represented by a number between 1 and 20. Ability scores are more than just your character’s base stats, they’re used to give your character advantages and disadvantages when rolling for different kinds of actions in the game. These 7 abilities are:</p>

                  <th>Wisdom<br>(WIS)</th>
                  <td>Represents willpower, common sense, and intuition. Wisdom is used when a character is applying faith, will, and guts. Wisdom is also used for spells and skills that were learned by training, rather than reading.</td>

                  <th>Charisma<br>(CHA)</th>

                <tr>
                  <th>Perception<br>(PER)</th>
                  <td>Represents senses and awareness. Perception is used when a character will need to "notice" something odd, significant, or dangerous around them. This can come from a trap ready to spring, a hidden enemy, or a clue hidden in a room. Characters who are undetected will become detected when another character or enemy makes a successful perception check.</td>

              </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Characters start with 10 points on each score, because 10 points means 0 modifier. Each number greater or less than 10 adds a positive or negative modifier, used in difficulty checks. For example:</p>

            <blockquote>
              Player: "Can Killgrog understand the hieroglyphs?"<br>
              GM: "Go ahead and make an intelligence check."<br>
              Player: "Uh oh, he's isn't exactly a genius..."<br>
              GM: "You can try and roll anyway."<br>
              Player: "I rolled a 10, but his INT score is 7, so minus 3..."<br>
              GM: "Yeah, that failed."<br>
              Killgrog: "It's a butterscotch recipe!"
            </blockquote>

            <p>When you make your character, consider taking points from areas where they are weak and placing those points on abilities where they are strong. That way, when your character makes difficulty checks, they're more likely to succeed at actions they're good at and more likely to fail at actions they're bad at. I recommend going <b>no lower than 7</b> and <b>no higher than 18</b> on any one ability; you never know when a brawler will need to make an intelligence roll to save his team.</p>

            <h4>Main Weapon</h4>

It can be a baseball bat, a broadsword, a healing staff, a blessed silver acoustic guitar with the name "Heather" written across it in hot-pink glitter... whatever you want. Every weapon will have a name, a description of the weapon's appearance and extra attributes, and a type, which determines the amount and type of dice you will roll to deal damage after landing a successful attack. Every few levels your character will add a dice to their weapon damage, as seen on the table below:</p>

            <h4>Sub Weapon</h4>
            <p>Some characters will carry a shield, others will carry a bow or some other ranged weapon, and others still will just carry another head-basher to rush in dual-wield style. Your character’s secondary weapon, or <b>sub weapon</b>, helps add an extra element to your character. Sub weapons also need a name, description, and type.</p>

            <p><b>Animal Companions</b><br>As a quick side note, your character might have an <b>animal companion</b> that fights alongside them in combat. You can add an animal companion to your character in place of the character’s sub weapon. Different sized animals will have different weapon types: cats are small, birds are ranged, bigger dogs are medium, bears are large, and as strange as it sounds, if your animal fits the use of a shield, like a massive turtle, it could also have that type. Animal companions all have the <b>same HP and AC as your character</b>, but do not get modifiers to add or subtract to difficulty checks.</p>
            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> Shield type animals only add their AC modifier to your character when being used as a shield.</p>

            <h4>Armor</h4>
            <p>Every character and creature in House Rules RPG has an <b>armor class</b> that represents how well protected they are. If your character decides to wear some kind of protective gear, be it steel armor or elbow pads, you'll give it a name and description here, along with giving it a type. Keep in mind that there are penalties to heavier armors, but the protection they provide can definitely improve your character's chances of defending against attacks. Below are the armor types and their benefits/penalties:</p>

            <table class="table">
              <thead>
                <th>Type</th>

                  <td>If your character is wearing regular clothing, non-magical robes, or nothing at all, they have an armor type of <i>none</i>.</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Medium (AC 14)</td>
                  <td>If your character is wearing bulletproof gear or partial steel/iron armor, they have an armor type of <i>medium</i>.</td>
                  <td>+4 to AC, -2 to initiative rolls</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Heavy (AC 16)</td>
                  <td>If your character is wearing dragon bones, a riot suit, or full steel/iron armor, they have an armor type of <i>heavy</i>.</td>
                  <td>+6 to AC, -4 to initiative rolls</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

            <h4>Gear</h4>
            <p>The <b>gear</b> section is for the extra equipment or magical items your character carries. This is where you'll add mementos and important nostalgic items from your character's past, provided they carry it on them at all times. You can update your character's sheet with important quest items or items bought as quest rewards if you want to keep track of what they are holding.</p>

            <h4>Extra Attributes</h4>
            <p><b>Extra attributes</b> are essentially the special conditions or powers that a weapon, a set of armor, or an item possesses. Maybe it glows when a special type of enemy is nearby, or it does +1 damage in certain weather. The object could protect against or enhance a certain kind of attack. An example would be a wand that shoots lightning; you'd describe the wand first and add something like "Allows wielder to fire a lightning bolt at a target for 1d8 electric damage." The wand would still be a Small (d4) weapon, but when used correctly it will do the same damage as a Medium (d8) weapon.</p>

            <p>Extra attributes are useful for leveraging a character's INT and WIS scores, specifically for magic users, but can also help rogue-type characters who have poison darts, for instance. Extra Attributes must be approved by the Game Master and/or the rest of the party before you play. It's not fair for you character to pull out a pocketwatch they inherited from their grandfather during a fight and claim that his ghost can be summoned to fight alongside you, <i>unless your Game Master knew about it and allowed it ahead of time.</i></p>

            <span id="details" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Details</h3>
            <p>In the <b>details</b> section you'll fill out your character’s appearance, personality, and backstory. You can be as vague or as specific as you'd like, but try to at least include important, game-relevant details.</p>

            <hr>

            <span id="perks" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Perks</h3>
            <p>Most tabletop RPGs fuss around with complicated skill trees, spells, feats, domains, and combat maneuvers, but House Rules RPG keeps it simple by giving each character 8 <b>perks</b>. Perks are special actions your character can take thanks to their body, mind, background, training, studies, and growth. Perks can be spells, combat techniques or tactics, magic powers, or professional skills.</p>

            <p><b>AoE</b><br>
              Some perks affect an area rather than a specific target. An example of an AoE (area of effect) perk would be a ninja dropping spikes to impede her pursuers, a cleric healing his allies as long as their close to him for a few rounds, or a mage casting a lava spell on a specific area of the environment. The diameter of the AoE depends on the perk being used, and if the perk does damage or heals the targets, the Player will only roll for one result, which applies to each target.</p>

            <h4>Using Perks</h4>
            <p>To use a perk that requires a check against a target's AC or for the target to make a saving throw, likely a damage or debuff perk, the Player will roll a <b>difficulty check</b> with the appropriate <b>modifier</b>. Using a perk still costs one of the uses per day, even if it fails. Buffs and healing perks do not require a difficulty check. When designing your character's perks, think about actions that are unique to their body or mind. A reptilian character might have a venomous bite as a perk, where as a healing-based character might have an assortment of restorative techniques. Each character will be different and will have different skills to consider.</p>

            <h4>Perks by Level</h4>
            <p>Characters start with 2 perks and unlock a new one <b>every 3 levels</b>. See the Level Rewards table at the end of this section for details.</p>

            <h3>Leveling Up</h3>
            <p>Characters usually <b>gain a level</b> at the end of a significant quest or story arc, and each new level comes with rewards. First, every time a character levels up, their Player will <b>roll a d10</b>, add their character's <b>vitality modifier</b>, and add the result to <b>increase their max hit points</b> (if their vitality modifier brings the result into the negatives, roll again or just add 1 point instead). Depending on the level your character is gaining, you might also <b>unlock a new perk</b>, gain a new <b>point</b> to add to an <b>ability</b> of your choice, or gain a <b>die</b> to add to your <b>weapon damage</b>. Your character also receives some <b>gold</b> that can be used to purchase new equipment and items.</p>

            <h4>Buying Items</h4>
            <p>Whether or not your party will get gold to spend on magic items after leveling up is something you should discuss in the first session. It can take some extra time to come up with magic items to sell, but there's lots of places to go for inspiration. Consider what kinds of items could be <b>useful</b> in-game: things that enable communication, protection, traversal, disguise, or power over the elements are a few ideas. You can have one-use items that give <b>advantage</b> to certain rolls or <b>add a point to a modifier</b> when used, or you could just have various interesting garbs and armors just for appearance. It's up to you and your party, be creative and <b>have fun with it</b>!</p>

            <h2>Combat</h2>
            <span id="init" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Initiative</h3>
            <p>If a conflict devolves into violence, you've entered combat, and combat starts with everyone <b>rolling for initiative</b>. Each character and type of enemy will make a <b>DEX difficulty check</b>. The character or enemy type with the highest roll is at the top of the order and the character or enemy type with the lowest roll is at the bottom. The first round starts with the top of the order’s first turn.</p>

            <h4>Surprise Round</h4>
            <p>If a character or creature is undetected, they can take a turn to attack a target <b>before the initiative roll</b>, as a surprise round.</p>

            <span id="turns" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Turns</h3>
            <p>A <b>turn</b> is a character or creature's <i>turn</i> to fight. They get to make <b>1 movement</b> and <b>1 action</b> (in that order) before the next person in the initiative order gets their turn. A movement is changing position, drawing a weapon, reloading a bow/gun, or using a movement-based perk. An action could be attacking a target, casting a spell, or using an action-based perk. You can only use <b>1 perk per turn</b>. A character or creature can also decide to either make a movement and skip their action or skip their movement and only take an action, if they want.</p>

            <span id="rounds" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Rounds</h3>
            <p>One <b>round</b> of combat represents roughly <b>6 seconds</b> in the game world. One round is everyone in the order getting their turn, moving, taking actions and attacking, defending and making saving throws. Once it's back to the first in the order it's a new round. Combat moves quickly but, if it's going too long, the Players and Game Master can always look for other options, like running away.</p>

            <p>When <b>outside of combat</b>, a user's perk that lasts for a specific number of rounds lasts for that many <b>hours</b> instead.</p>

            <hr>

            <span id="attacks" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Attacking</h3>
            <p>Attacks can be made with unarmed strikes, weapons, spells, curses, summoned creatures, thrown objects... whatever the character or creature pleases. Attacks are just actions, so the Player will make a difficulty check by <b>rolling a d20</b> and applying the appropriate <b>ability score modifier</b>. There are two differences between an action and an attack; the first is that attacks are always checked against the target’s <b>armor class</b>, and the second is that the attack still fails if it's <b>equal to</b> the target's armor class.</p>

            <p>If the attack is a close to mid-range <b>physical strike</b> with a sword, club, staff, pole, dagger, wrench, etc. and the attack hits, the attacker rolls their weapon's <b>damage dice</b> to see how many hit points the target loses. If the attack fails, play continues to the next character or creature in the order.</p>

            <h4>Saving Throws</h4>
            <p>Successful physical strikes cannot be defended against (unless the target has a perk that allows them to parry or dodge), but ranged attacks like arrows, spells, or bullets require the target to <b>roll a d20</b> for a <b>saving throw</b>, basically a dodge, and add the appropriate <b>ability score modifier</b>. If the resulting saving throw is higher than the attack roll, the target successfully evades the attack. If not, the attacker deals damage.</p>

            <span id="death" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>When a character's HP is <b>reduced to zero</b> the character <b>falls unconscious</b>. The Player has 3 <b>death saving throws</b> (using a d20 with no modifier) as a way for their character to cling to life and give their party members a chance to heal them and bring them back from the brink. <i>Healing may or may not wake them, but the character will no longer be dying.</i> If the Player manages to roll <b>3 saves</b> (3 rolls higher than 10) and the character hasn't been healed, they wake with 1d6 HP. If they fail all 3 saving throws before their party can stabilize them, <b>they die</b>.</p>

            <p>Some Game Masters may allow for an afterlife of some kind as a way to keep the Player in the game or allow the Player to create a new character to bring in on the next quest, but it's recommended that ghost characters not be given corporeal power or a means to speak with the party unless a party member has a perk that allows them to do so. If death isn't a punishment then there's no risk to combat!</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> Game Masters, make character death satisfying or temporary if you want to maintain an amicable relationship with your Players.</p>

            <span id="theme" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Writing Quests</h3>
            <p>The Game Master is, for all intents and purposes, the lead storyteller. They describe the world, the non-player characters, and the events that the Players will trigger by traversing through, and interacting with, the setting. To be an effective Game Master, you must know how to set up compelling scenes, obstacles, and conflicts for your party and become an actor, breathing life into every NPC (hostile or otherwise) that the Players come across. It's a tough job, but it can be incredibly rewarding.</p>

            <h4>Theme</h4>
            <p>Before you start designing combat scenarios and setting details, you should take some time to think about what kind of story you want to tell. If you're really interested in storytelling, do a little research on <a href="http://www.novel-writing-help.com/what-is-theme.html">themes</a>, specifically what they are and why they are important to narrative. If that's more work than you're willing to do, you can click or tap the "36 Plot Starters" button below for a list of starting points.</p>

            <span id="settings" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Settings</h3>
            <p>A change of scenery can easily ramp up the tension or provide a lull between action, something you'll want to take advantage of, but try not to have too many conflicting environments or lots of extraneous travel in one story or you risk confusing or boring your Players. Do you drop your players into a swamp? Are they sneaking through an ancient temple trying to avoid dangerous cultists? Or maybe they're making their way through a decimated version of Manhattan? The number of settings and amount of detail will change depending on your quest, but take some time to consider each one and try to sum it up in a short, clear, descriptive way.</p>
            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> When adding settings to your Setting List on the <a href="quest.html">Quest</a> page, try to write them as each area that you'll create a map for. For example, if the setting is an abandoned castle, don't just right "abandoned castle"; write "Abandoned Castle - First Floor", "Abandoned Castle - Basement", etc.</p>

            <hr>

            <span id="npcs" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Non-Player Characters</h3>
            <p>Every good quest has <b>non-player characters (NPCs)</b>, controlled by the Game Master, for the Players to interact with. These are not just the townsfolk and allies, but also the enemies and secret-keepers of the game. A good Game Master will try to breathe life into the NPCs of the quest, giving them unique personalities and voices. They'll hopefully become characters that the Players will get invested in, that they'll love (or love to hate). Important NPCs will require character sheets as well, although you maybe don't want spend too much time on the details of cannon-fodder enemies. Instead, use the Enemy Creator on the <a href="quest.html">Quest</a> page when <b>creating simple enemies</b>.</p>

            <p class="well"><b>Note:</b> If you're creating an NPC higher than level 1 using the character/enemy creator, first set their vitality, then their level, then click the "Update HP" button to simulate adding Hit Points for each level the character has gained. Try to stick with the first or second roll, to simulate the randomness involved in rolling dice for each level.</p>

            <span id="setup" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Setup</h3>

            <h4>Prologue</h4>
            <p>Sometimes a quest needs a little narration up front to set the scene, introduce some NPCs, and ease the Players into the world and put the quest into perspective. Not every quest will require this level of easing though, some will start off with a bang! If that's the case, skip the setup and jump straight into setting the goal.</p>

            <h4>The Goal</h4>
            <p>Every quest starts with a <b>goal</b>. Whether or not the climax and resolution have anything to do with the original goal is irrelevant, what matters is that the party starts their quest with a <i>specific purpose</i>. This is a one-sentence call-to-action that sums up the reason the characters are taking part in the quest. Are they after a large amount of treasure? Have they been contracted to stop a group of kidnappers? Maybe they must prove their innocence after being falsely (or rightly) accused of murder. Whatever it is, your Players must be given a <i>clear goal</i> to strive towards. Keep the theme in mind when writing the goal.</p>

            <span id="maps" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Map-based Quests</h3>
            <p>House Rules RPG uses a system for building quests based on level design; you'll first create <b>maps</b> of the locations where the quest takes place, then split it up into distinct <b>areas</b> to fill with <b>events</b>, which you'll detail on the <a href="quest.html">Quest</a> page.</p>

            <h4>Maps</h4>
            <p>For <b>creating a map</b> you can use paper and pencil or digital tools to visualize it before building it in the quest creator. A good map will require a bit of <b>level design</b>; you may want to do some research on pacing and learn about what makes a satisfying level before diving in and drawing your maps. Also, try not to spend a lot of time adding a lot of details. The map should be a simple guide, a visual aid to the mental model of the settings that you'll describe to your Players with words. An example of a map would be the first floor of a haunted house, a maze-like path through a swamp, a city block, or a space vessel.</p>

            <p>Some useful tools for creating maps are:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><a href="https://donjon.bin.sh/d20/dungeon/">d20 Random Dungeon Generator by donjon</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.gozzys.com/dungeon-maps">Gozzy's Dungeon Map Generator</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.myth-weavers.com/generate_dungeon.php">Myth Weavers' Dungeon Generator</a></li>

            </ol>

            <p>And for learning about level design, I suggest checking out the following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWgc20zbRXk&list=PLDPL7seU9mMcBZ8yonxZvyEcFHg8dy1wl">Extra Credits Design Club - Durlag's Tower</a></li>

              <li><a href="http://worldofleveldesign.com/categories/level_design_tutorials/how-to-plan-level-designs-game-environments-workflow.php">World of Level Design - How to Plan Level Designs and Game Environments in 11 Steps</a></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Those last few resources get in deep with theme, pacing, environments, and more, so if you're not ready to become a great level designer it's okay to just stick with the dungeon generators.</p>

            <h4>Areas</h4>
            <p>Every map should have at least 1 <b>area</b> with a name, description, and events. Areas are the rooms, corridors, clearings, and dead ends that your players move between and where events take place. Examples would be the foyer of the haunted house, a clearing in the swamp, a bakery on the city block, or the galley of the space vessel.</p>

            <h4>Quest Events</h4>
            <p>Enemy encounters, traps, puzzles, NPC interactions, and quest items are all examples of <b>quest events</b>. Quest events are the <b>high points</b> in the story, the obstacles and revelations, the moments of excitement between travel and interrogating and low-impact interactions. When you add an area to a map on the <a href="quest.html">Quest</a> page, you'll be able to add quest events specific to that area. When the Players enter or peer into an area, they can trigger traps, find quest items or hostile NPCs, a puzzle obstacle that they need to solve, or a clue that they need to move forward.</p>

            <h4>Escalation</h4>
            <p>Quest events should <b>escalate</b> as the Players progress through the quest. I recommend a minimum of 3 enemy encounters: a fun one, a challenge, and a boss. These encounters don't have to devolve into combat, but if they do there's a way to pace the combat for a satisfying experience. The first encounter should be with a few enemies a <b>level (or a few levels) lower</b> than your Player's characters. It's a chance for them to <b>stretch their adventuring muscles</b> and play with their newly aqcuired skills in a safe setting. The challenging encounter should match up the Players against <b>foes at their same level</b>, something to give them a test of their strength but with a slight advantage. The boss fight is the real battle; a true test of might and courage that pits the Players against a creature or character at a <b>higher level than their own</b>, with a few (2-3) perks of their own and/or some minions to help <b>amp up the challenge</b>. Beating the boss will give your Players a real run for their money and a satisfying conclusion to the quest, should they win. Boss creatures/characters should have their own character sheets, while simple enemies can be created with the simple enemy creator on the <a href="quest.html">Quest</a> page.</p>

            <hr>

            <span id="wrapUp" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Wrap Up</h3>
            <h4>Epilogue</h4>
            <p>Every quest should end on a low point and have an <b>epilogue</b>, so the Players can take some time to wrap things up. This is where they'll return from their journey, say goodbye to NPCs, and claim their rewards.<p>

            <h4>Cliffhanger</h4>
            <p>With the quest at its end you may wish to give your Players a <i>taste of what's brewing on the horizon</i>, which you can include in the form of an optional <b>cliffhanger</b>. Give them just enough of a morsel to get them excited for the next session.<p>

            <hr>

            <span id="transitions" class="anchor"></span>
            <h3>Transitions</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you may want to take a session to <b>regroup</b> and give your Players a rest themselves. It helps to think of sessions as high points, once in awhile you need to let your party breathe and adjust their course. Think of these as <b>transitions</b> between story arcs. Give your Players <b>low-risk interactions</b> and provide moments where they can dig deeper into their characters thoughts and feelings, moments to build their characters into more complete creations.</p>

            <p>For example, you can give your characters time to <b>visit past victories</b>, take a trip home to see their <b>family</b>, or to reflect on their <b>losses</b>. This can also be a good place to <b>switch out party members</b>; you can give their character a peaceful, satisfying ending rather than just letting them vanish out of thin air.</p>

              <li>Don't talk over each other.</li>
              <li>Don't take actions for another Player's character (unless your party allows perks that cause possession or mind-control, but if that's the case it shouldn't be offensive).</li>
